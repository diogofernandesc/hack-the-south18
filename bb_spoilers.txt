Abandoned Area: The White family residence at the very end.
Adult Fear: Oh, let us count the ways... Dying of a terminal illness, and being unable to pay for treatment. Having a loved one die of a drug overdose while being too drugged-out yourself to do anything about it—or notice. Being caught in a plane crash. If you don't find plane crashes scary, you will after you see the Season 2 finale. In "Dead Freight": A child being murdered, and the evidence being hidden so thoroughly as to make the crime unsolvable. In "Ozymandias": A domestic fight happening while the whole family is present, forcing a child to call the police on his own father, resulting in said father kidnapping his baby daughter and running away.  Being kidnapped and forced into slavery, and being tortured so badly that you lose your will to fight back.

Affably Evil: Saul Goodman, the cheerfully corrupt lawyer. Mike Ehrmantraut is gruff but personable and loyal, as well as a loving grandfather, but he'll straight-up murder you if it needs to be done. Jack has an easy-going, down-homey demeanor, but he's a cold-blooded killer and Neo-Nazi. Todd has a very mild and friendly personality, but is also a cold-blooded criminal who kills without hesitation or regret. The dichotomy is best seen when he apologizes to his murder victim immediately before shooting her in the head, and brings an enslaved Jesse two flavors of ice cream (since he didn't know which Jesse prefers) as a reward for good work.

Affectionate Gesture to the Head: Jack gives Todd an affectionate noogie (still holding a gun) during the Tension-Cutting Laughter after he asks Jack not to kill Jesse because he's still trying to impress Lydia with their cooking.
Ain't Too Proud to Beg: Both Walt and Gale plead for their lives. In "Ozymandias," Walt begs for Hank's life. Hank refuses to, at least in part because he's resigned to the fact that Jack has already decided to kill him. And then in the finale, Walt begs Jesse to Mercy Kill him. Jesse refuses. Inverted in season one, when Walt refuses Elliott and Gretchen's offer to pay for his treatment.

Alas, Poor Villain: In the episode "Face Off," the extremely moving music as Gus walks to his death reminds you that he was once a similar guy to Walt, and he'll die failing to get his final revenge on the people who killed his "brother". Similarly, the sheer amount of anger and sadness in Hector's face as he looks at his target, Gus before setting off the bomb that will kill both of them makes you almost feel sorry for him. Debatable as to how much of a villain he was, but Mike's death. Granted,  Mike's a stone cold murderer and by no means a good guy but the writers manage to avoid making this a case of Kick the Son of a Bitch by having Mike become a guy who just wants out of the game... and then Walt goes and kills him over some petty ego bullshit.

Anti-Hero: Walter and Jesse are deeply involved in the methamphetamine industry, and are often forced to commit gruesome acts to survive. At the same time, Walt is motivated to provide for his family should his cancer claim him, and Jesse is really just in the business because it's what he does best. By the time season five starts, Walter is motivated only by greed and power, while Jesse is more conflicted than ever. The intention of the showrunners is for the character to "start as Mr. Chips and end up as Scarface."
Anyone Can Die: Any character that dies on the show stays dead. Throughout the entire show, the list includes: Emilio, Krazy-8, Tuco, Tortuga, Combo, Jane, the Cousins, Gale Boetticher, Victor, the Cartel bosses, Héctor Salamanca, Tyrus, Gus, Drew Sharp, Mike, Declan and his crew, Gomez, Hank, Andrea, the Nazis, Todd, Jack, and WALT. Lydia ends the series with, at most, a few days to live. Needless to say if you took on this show you should have kept your resume current.
Arms Dealer: Two Gangland Gun Runners have been seen so far: A genial yokel with a van full of serious hardware who sells a couple of Bulletproof Vests, handguns and some hollow-point bullets to the Salamanca Twins. They test his own vest out before paying up, but luckily for him he sells good merchandise. An even more genial vendor (Mr. Ellsworth from Deadwood, no less) who meets Walt in a motel room and gives him a brief lesson in Gun Safety and proper use. He's later seen in a flash-forward selling a now on-the-run Walt a stolen car with an M60 in the trunk.

Armor-Piercing Question: In "Ozymandias", Skyler realises that something is terribly wrong when Walt grows increasingly irate when she asks him, "Where is Hank?"
Artistic License  Law: Saul Goodman asks Walt and Jesse to give him a dollar each, claiming that it's a retainer and he's therefore forbidden from revealing anything they discuss because of attorney-client privilege. Anyone who knows how attorney-client privilege works knows it doesn't apply here since Saul is himself part of an ongoing criminal conspiracy. However, he might have been twisting the truth so they would stop threatening him and start trusting him. Occasionally, methamphetamine is misclassified as a Schedule I substance on the show — it's actually Schedule IIB. This is easiest seen screen captures of the newspaper clippings on Walter's wall while he's hiding away in New Hampshire.

Ascended Extra: Mike, who starts out as a One-Scene Wonder in the season two finale, becomes a regular in season three and is one of the show's most central characters by season five. Todd worked his way up this ladder in Season five, starting out as just an underling in Vamonos Pest. Two episodes later, he helps the guys in their train heist, and two episodes after that, he becomes Walt's new lab assistant. In the second part of the season, he becomes Lydia's new primary cook when his uncle's crew massacres Declan's. Hector Salamanca starts off as a seemingly minor character in two episodes towards the beginning of season two, but returns in season three and four in arcs that gradually reveal him to be not only an important player in the Mexican cartel, but in the backstory of one of the main characters.

Asshole Victim: Oh so many. Hank, Todd, Lydia, the Cartel Dons, Uncle Jack, Krazy-8, Spooge, and perhaps even Walt, to name a few.
A-Team Firing: In season five, the episode "To'hajiilee" ends with a shootout where none of the people involved seem to hit anything. This is cleared up in the next episode.
Badass Boast:Walt: Let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, you think that of me? No! I am the one who knocks! Something of a subversion in that his initial aim is to reassure Skyler, but just ends up panicking her all the more as she realizes for the first time that her husband may very well be a murderer. Gus, after poisoning the cartel, makes one to the remaining people in the Don's mansion, who promptly flee. In "Crawl Space", Gus delivers one to Héctor Salamanca at the retirement home, saying that he killed off all members of the cartel and Jesse killed his grandson, making him the last of the Salamanca line. Walt gets a one line Badass Boast in the season 4 finale after pulling off a double Batman Gambit and defeating Gus: "I won".

Bad Boss: Tuco. Shortly after we're introduced to him, we get to see him beat one of his henchmen to death for reminding Walt that he works for Tuco. Gus is a cold-blooded, Faux Affably Evil Bad Boss. Kind of. He slits a mook's throat just to make a point (and incidentally to punish him for carelessness in being seen at the scene of a crime). On the other hand, he seems to be grooming Jesse for a more responsible position and the show implies that Jesse makes the wrong choice when he picks Walt over Gus. Giancarlo Esposito has an interesting take on this here: Gus treated Victor as a member of his "family", but had to kill him because he jeopardized it.

Giancarlo Esposito has an interesting take on this here: Gus treated Victor as a member of his "family", but had to kill him because he jeopardized it.
Bait-and-Switch: In "Confessions", Walt is seen sitting down with a video camera in what he states was his confession before the show cut to a commercial. Hank and Marie receive the confession after meeting with Walt and, to their surprise, it's not a confession of Walt fessing up to the sins he committed while in the drug trade, but a carefully constructed lie meant to frame Hank.
Bald of Awesome: Quite a few characters. Hank, Mike, and Tio Salamanca are naturally bald. Walt shaves his head early in the show, but that's due to the chemo drugs he is taking. The Salamanca brothers also sport shaved heads. Jesse also crops his hair down after a traumatic event in an apparent effort to toughen himself up. The trope is even exploited in the Season 5 episode "Rabid Dog," in which a paranoid Jesse is spooked by the sight of a tough-looking bald man near where he is supposed to meet Heisenberg. Jesse, believing that the other man is a hitman, flees the scene in fear; right afterward, it's shown that the bald man is just an ordinary man waiting to meet up with his wife and child.
Batman Gambit: Two of epic proportions in the last two episodes of season 4 by Walt. First, he gives Brock a poison with ricin-like symptoms and steals Jesse's ricin cigarette; Jesse storms his house wanting to kill him, since only the two of them knew about the ricin, but Walt convinces him at gunpoint that he would have nothing to gain and that it's a ploy by Gus to gain Jesse's compliance in killing Walt. When his initial attempt to kill Gus fails, he acquires Hector Salamanca as an ally, convinces him to talk to the DEA so Gus will think he's snitching, then booby-traps his wheelchair. This plan hinges on the hopes that a) Héctor hates Gus more than he hates Walt, b) Gus will insist on killing Héctor in person and c) Héctor is willing to kill himself to take Gus down with him. Amazingly, it all works. In Season 5, Jesse and Hank manage to scare Walt into driving to exactly where his money is hidden with a falsified picture, and Jesse egging Walt on so he won't stop and try to reason out whether or not Jesse actually has the money. It works so well that Walt ends up driving so recklessly he probably broke every New Mexico motor vehicle law on the books. All it took was knowing what Walter really cared about, even more than his family. The series finale is one long Batman Gambit as Walt executes several complicated plans in order to get revenge on Elliot and Gretchen, Lydia, and the Nazis.

Bavarian Fire Drill: In "Cornered", Jesse wants to entice some meth heads, who have stolen some Blue Sky, out of their home. How does he do this? He grabs a shovel and starts digging outside. One of the meth heads comes outside and asks what he's doing. Jesse tells him he's digging and asks him to take over, leaving the house open and unguarded.
Being Evil Sucks: Walt makes lots of money manufacturing crystal meth, but his activities end up destroying his relationship with his family, to the point where they all despise him and openly want him to die. Jesse, for his part, is nearly killed on a few occasions and sees one girlfriend die of a drug overdose and another murdered. Almost all of the individuals they deal with in the drugs trade have a violent, premature end.
Berserk Button: Walt is incredibly defensive of his son in the first season. Jesse, on the other hand, gets protective of anyone's children, like Spooge's son, or Brock, or Tomas Cantillo, or Drew Sharp. Eventually, Walt's biggest Berserk Button has nothing to do with his family, but with his Pride. Attacking his massive ego becomes the absolute most dangerous thing you can do, as Mike discovered. Do NOT call "Spooge's Lady" a skank if you value your life. Tuco Salamanca has several; his employees speaking out of term, demanding payments upfront, insulting his family, etc. Almost anything can set him off, especially when he's under the influence of Walt's meth.

BFG: In season 5, Walt gets his hands on an M60 machine gun, a weapon so huge it was nicknamed "The Pig" during the Vietnam War. One of Jack's gunmen uses an AA12 automatic shotgun.

Big Bad: Season 1: Tuco is set up to be this at the end of Season 1, but dies within the first few episodes of Season 2. Season 3: The Cousins initially, but they become a Disc-One Final Boss. Gus Fring and his empire take up the slack for the rest of season 3. Season 4: Gus Fring. Season 5, first half: Walter himself is the Big Bad by way of Villain Protagonist. His Heisenberg side creates much of the conflict. Season 5, second half: 'Uncle' Jack Welker, with Todd Alquist as The Dragon.

Big "NO!": Jesse before Todd shoots the kid at the end of "Dead Freight". Also, Jesse after Todd shoots Andrea.
Also, Jesse after Todd shoots Andrea.
Birth/Death Juxtaposition: "Phoenix" is the episode in which Walt's daughter Holly is born and Jane dies.
Bittersweet Ending: The finale of Season 4, Walt has killed Gus, protected his family, and come out on top through a superb double Batman Gambit, but to do so he had to make more compromises and put more innocents in danger than ever before, even poisoning a small child. The Grand Finale as well. Walt is dead, his family has completely disowned him, and the world knows that he's Heisenberg... But he died on his own terms, effectively eradicated Blue Sky, he's managed to rescue Jesse from the Aryans, Jesse passes up a chance to kill him, and he manages to get his money, over 9 million, to his children via Gretchen and Elliot. He gives Skyler the coordinates to Hank and Steve's bodies ensuring that they'll have a proper burial, and Skyler may be able to get the feds off her back in exchange for the information. Jesse is free from slavery and all ties to the meth business, and might actually make the most out of his life having had aspirations of being a carpenter during his enslavement. And Todd, Jack, Lydia and the Aryans have all gotten their just comeuppance.

Black and Grey Morality: "Heisenberg" vs the Cartel. Season 4 gives us Walt vs Gus. Though this became Evil Versus Evil by the end. From Season 5B, Hank versus Heisenberg quickly became this, as Hank's pursuit of Heisenberg proves to be not without its own compromises. Uncle Jack's crew of Neo-Nazis versus Heisenberg.
From Season 5B, Hank versus Heisenberg quickly became this, as Hank's pursuit of Heisenberg proves to be not without its own compromises.
Black Dude Dies First: Look at the list of names under Anyone Can Die — the deaths in the series overwhelmingly happen to Hispanic men and women. Among the main characters, Gus is the first to die. All of the main characters to survive the series are white.
Bleed 'em and Weep: Walt killing Krazy-8. Jesse killing Gale. Well, it's more of a "weep and bleed 'em" scenario.

Jesse killing Gale. Well, it's more of a "weep and bleed 'em" scenario.
Blue and Orange Morality: The neo-Nazis. They are a particularly despicable lot who have no qualms about murdering children and are even crueler than Gus, but they find the state of the U.S. utterly dreadful:Kenny: Nanny state. I see a kid with a bicycle helmet on, I want to smack the shit out of him  like for his own good.
Blofeld Ploy: In the season 4 premiere "Box Cutter", Gus seems about to discipline Walt, but instead kills an underling and departs without a word. His motivation is left ambiguous. However, the underling, Victor, was seen at the scene of a crime and could have led authorities back to Gus. Walt, on the other hand, suspects that Gus killed Victor for cooking a batch of meth, taking on more authority than Gus had given him. Although that scene could be interpreted this way, Gus' motivations aren't exactly cloudy: Victor revealed that he was ready to replace Walt if need be, meaning that Gale's death at the end of the previous season was not enough to bring Walt the security he wanted. Gus then gives walt the Radish Cure by killing Victor, showing Walt how concequential gaining that security is.

Bluffing the Authorities: Gus Fring is questioned by the police about the murder of his one-time criminal underling Gale Boetticher after trace evidence showed that Gus had been at Gale's house not long before his death. Gus, being The Chessmaster and a Villain with Good Publicity, spins the story and claims that after years of not talking, Gale had contacted Gus recently, invited him over, and tried to get him to invest in something that seemed shady. Gus refused, and then read about the murder several days later. Because Gus has such good publicity and is so methodical about covering his tracks, everyone except Hank buys it.
Book Ends: In series finale "Felina," Walt arrives at the Neo-Nazi compound wearing the same outfit he wore in the first episode, "Pilot": pastel jacket, green button-up shirt, white undershirt and beige slacks. For most of the series, Walt is in remission and shaves his head. However, in the final season, his cancer comes back and he lets his hair grow back out, mirroring his state in the first season, albeit a lot more disheveled. Both Hanks introduction scene and death scene feature him making backhanded compliments about Walts intelligence and attending slight lack of social craft. Both are clearly made out of love but in very different situations. Both the first and final episodes take place on Walt's birthday.

Break the Haughty: Hank and Jesse both experience extreme pressure that cracks their arrogant facades. Walt goes through this in "Ozymandias": Hank's death at the hands of Jack's crew, Jack's crew taking his money, his family abandoning him, and even his baby daughter wanting her mother over him, finally makes him realize what he's become. Walt's crushing continues in the following episode "Granite State": Saul's new-identity man sets him up in a remote shack where the cancer eats at his strength. He keeps starting the eight-mile walk to the nearest town, but even the Heisenberg hat can't give him the power to do it. He can't get any of the money — all that remains of the legacy that justifies any of this business — to his family without suspicion, and when he tries to send them some through a friend of Walt Jr., his son angrily rejects him.

Briefcase Full of Money: Lots of characters, though usually not in an actual briefcase; it's more likely to be a backpack or duffel bag, and in one scene there's a shipping pallet full of money. In the end, the totality of Walt's fortune is contained in seven plastic 55-gallon barrels full of money.
Bulletproof Vest: The Cousins purchase a pair from an illegal arms dealer. Played realistically: one of them shoots the dealer in the chest to test the vests — he survives, but one of his ribs is broken and he's left moaning in pain as the Cousins walk away. Saul wears one under his suit after Huell suddenly goes AWOL in "To'hajiilee." Jack's crew wear them when tooled in "To'hajiilee."
Saul wears one under his suit after Huell suddenly goes AWOL in "To'hajiilee."
Call-Back: In episode 2, Jesse fails to appreciate how important a plastic bin is when dissolving a body in hydrofluoric acid. Three seasons later, he finally gets to do it properly, saying "trust us" when Mike questions if it'll work. When Walt serves Krazy 8 a sandwich, Krazy 8 plucks off the crust, which Walter makes a point to cut off when he gives him another sandwich. Ever since killing Krazy 8, when Walt makes a sandwich, he cuts off the crust. A season after they needed it, Jesse tells Badger that the RV should have "one of those buzzers that tells you when you leave the key in the ignition." The scene where Gus fires Walter is pretty reminiscent of Mike's backstory from "Half Measure". One wonders if Gus would have gotten the same speech from Mike if he was around at the time. In the Season 5 premiere, Walt makes the number '52' with his bacon to mark his 52nd birthday. Just like Skyler did for him making a '50' on his 50th birthday in the first ever episode, albeit with veggie bacon. The bacon tradition appears again three episodes later in "Fifty-One" with the titular number. This also stands to remind us that at least one more year passes over the course of the last 12 episodes of the series. The unsliced pizza sits atop the White garage for quite a long time. Early in the series a student tries to talk Walt into giving him a passing grade because he got a 58% and says he was "close." Walt refuses. A few episodes later Walt is grading papers and the student gets a 40%. Walter writes "Not even close" on it. In Season 3 when the school is discussing the air crash we see the student again trying to weasel his way into a passing grade by claiming that if a college student's roommate dies he gets passing grades and think that the school here should do the same. In Season 5, "Confessions", Walt records a video of himself opening with "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico. 87104", just as he did in the Cold Open to the pilot episode. However, in the first tape, he explicitly says that the tape is not to be considered a confession of anything; in the second one, he proceeds "this is my confession", before proceeding to pin everything on Hank. In "Rabid Dog", Skyler says "I knew this would happen! I told you someday someone would show up at our door", a callback to the "I am the one who knocks" speech. Meanwhile, Saul describing Jesse as a rabid dog that needs to be put down echoes Jesse in rehab, confessing to putting down a dog when he's really talking about killing Gale. Also in "Rabid Dog", the  attempted setup at the end mirrors  the setup from "Better Call Saul" - Jesse, like Badger, is supposed to meet Heisenberg on a bench in a public setting, but is misdirected by a simple coincidence involving another bald man nearby. The end of "To'hajiilee", when a huge shootout occurs, mirrors a larger-scale version of Hank's shootout with Tuco from "Grilled", the event that first sparked his PTSD and set him on the downward spiral he's been in the entire series. "To'hajiilee" is also the second time in the series Walt stood in that desert with a handgun awaiting a standoff, and the second time he couldn't bring himself to do it. Not long into "Ozymandias", when Walt is rolling his last cash barrel away in the middle of the desert, the pair of pants that blew away in the first episode are visible if you keep an eye on the foreground. A more obvious "Ozymandias" example is the pilot flashback during the intro, returning to show how far Walt has come from the pilot to the ante-penultimate episode. "Granite State": Walt tries to threaten Saul into working for him, like he did in "Live Free or Die", but he's interrupted by a coughing fit. Skyler being interrogated by the cops strongly parallels the scene where Walt finds out about the cancer◊ and Walt Jr tells his father to "fucking die already" - but for different, much darker reasons. In the series finale, Jesse daydreams about building a box, referencing his monologue in "Kafkaesque" where he tells the support worker about the one time he put everything he had into a school project. Also in the finale, the shot of Jesse  crying while pointing a gun at Walt is almost identical to the shot from the season 3 finale of him  about to kill Gale. The very first scene of the show is Walt preparing to be caught by the police, then in the very last scene  he finally is. Albeit posthumously. The titles of the episodes "Live Free or Die" and "Granite State" are meant to parallel each other, as they're named after the State Motto and State Nickname of New Hampshire, respectively.  In the former, we get our first Flash Forward to Walt on the run from the police after moving to New Hampshire. In the latter, we finally get to see how he got there.

Skyler being interrogated by the cops strongly parallels the scene where Walt finds out about the cancer◊ and Walt Jr tells his father to "fucking die already" - but for different, much darker reasons.
Also in the finale, the shot of Jesse  crying while pointing a gun at Walt is almost identical to the shot from the season 3 finale of him  about to kill Gale.
The very first scene of the show is Walt preparing to be caught by the police, then in the very last scene  he finally is. Albeit posthumously.
The titles of the episodes "Live Free or Die" and "Granite State" are meant to parallel each other, as they're named after the State Motto and State Nickname of New Hampshire, respectively.  In the former, we get our first Flash Forward to Walt on the run from the police after moving to New Hampshire. In the latter, we finally get to see how he got there.
Calling the Old Man Out: When trying to convince Walter to go into therapy, Walter Jr. delivers one so poignant, it's almost a Tear Jerker. And in Season 5B, he delivers a second one, considerably harsher, after Walter calls him from hiding and tries to arrange for him to receive some of the money he has left.
And in Season 5B, he delivers a second one, considerably harsher, after Walter calls him from hiding and tries to arrange for him to receive some of the money he has left.
Camera Abuse: When Walter offs Uncle Jack with a headshot, the camera is positioned so that the latter's brains splatter all over it.
Can't Kill You, Still Need You: The main plot of Season 4. Gus can't kill Walt and Jesse because he has no one else to cook meth for him. Enforced by Jesse when he kills Gale so that Gus can't kill Walt. The characters like to take advantage of this trope by forcibly extending it to cover other characters; Walt knows he's needed, so he refuses to work if Jesse's killed, thereby also making him indirectly "needed". Later, Jesse does the same for Walt. At the end of "Ozymandias", Jesse has become this to Todd. In "Madrigal," Lydia escapes death at Mike's hands because she can provide methylamine. (Yet another "half measure" he should've avoided.)

Can't Take Criticism: This goes hand in hand with Walt's ego. It's why he killed Mike for calling him out for said ego causing problems in the meth business.
Cassandra Truth: Whenever Walt protests that he didn't kill Hank. By this point he's known as a Consummate Liar and the murderous kingpin of a meth empire, so no one believes him.

Celebrity Resemblance: Lampshaded by Saul Goodman's quote "If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it." See this link to see the striking resemblance. This trope is exploited by Ted Beneke on his birthday by having Skyler sing to him "Happy Birthday Mr President" on his birthday simply because she has some resemblance to Marilyn Monroe.

Chekhov's Boomerang: The ricin: Having used their original vial in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Tuco during season 2, Walt and Jesse cooked up a new ricin cigarette in season 4 to kill Gus. Walt tried convincing Jesse, ultimately without success, to use it on Gus, and later Walt convinced Jesse that Gus had stolen it and used it to poison Brock, even though Walt was responsible for poisoning the boy, and he actually used Lily of the Valley. In the first part of season 5, Walt planned to use it on Lydia, but changed his mind. Later, Jesse realised that Walt was responsible for stealing the cigarette, and finally turned against him. Over a year later, Walt retrieves it from its hiding place in his now-abandoned home, seals it in a sweetener that Lydia prefers in her tea and places it in the jar at the table where Lydia always sits at the cafe. The last we see of Lydia is her in bed, dealing with the symptoms of ricin poisoning.
Chekhov's Gun In "Crazy Handful of Nothin", Walt teaches about fulminate of mercury when he tries to explain reactions to his high school students. At the end of the episode, Walt uses the same chemicals to blow up Tuco's lair. Played straight in "One Minute" where the "on the house" bullet that the Cousins got from the arms dealer is used by Hank to shoot Marco in the face. Also see the Season 4 premiere we get Chekhov's Box Cutter and the final shot quite possibly gives us Chekhov's Folder. Saul's identity-eraser guy. When Walt tries to use him in "Crawl Space" he finds out that all their money's been given to Ted by Skyler without his knowledge. In Season 5, Walt suggests that Jesse use him, and he almost does until he finds out about the ricin cigarette. In "Ozymandias", Walt finally uses him in the run from the cops after his family abandons him. Walter's gun, throughout all of Season 4. It is, however, used as a prominent prop in various scenes where its presence alone has either thematic or plot-relevant resonance. However, he doesn't actually use it until the end of the final episode. Ted's rug. Jesse's Roomba vacuum robot, which Walt plants the re-doctored ricin cigarette in to make him think it was just dropped on the floor instead of stolen. The gun Mike kept in his getaway bag in "Say My Name". Walt's copy of Leaves of Grass, which the camera makes sure to show in the bathroom in "Gliding Over All" before it becomes very important later. The knives in the flashback that opens "Ozymandias" come into play in the present day when Walt gets home. Lydia's Stevia obsession becomes her undoing.

Chekhov's Skill: In "Gray Matter", Badger learning the "helicopter" move from working as a sign-spinner. Later in the episode, when Badger and Jesse are fighting over one batch of rejected meth too many (for Badger, at least), he utilizes the move...using Jesse as the "sign"."HELICOPTER, BITCH!" Walt training himself to fast draw his pistol in season 4 apparently becomes a waste of time when he realizes he'll never get a chance to use this ability against Gus, but then he uses it to rescue Jesse at the end of the season.

Chessmaster: Gus is gradually revealed to be one of these, a reputation cemented halfway through Season 3 when he arranges the death of a leader in the cartel and the elimination of two of the relatives of the man he holds responsible for the death of his friend two decades ago. Walt gradually becomes one as well as terribly revealed in the last shot of Season 4. Season 4 is a chess match between Walt and Gus, which Walt wins. Walt becomes an even bigger chessmaster in the series finale.

Choke Holds: How Walter finally eliminates Domingo (AKA Crazy Eight) in the third episode. It takes a minute or two and Domingo has time to stab Walter a few times with a shard of broken plate. Jesse finally exacting his revenge on Todd by choking him as well as breaking his neck with the chains he was bound up in at the end of "Felina".
Jesse finally exacting his revenge on Todd by choking him as well as breaking his neck with the chains he was bound up in at the end of "Felina".
Chronic Villainy: Walt would always go back to making meth no matter how dangerous the situation is. He gives up his drug business at the end of "Gliding Over All," intending to keep his head down and quietly launder the money he has for the rest of his life. Then Hank realizes that Heisenberg has been right under his nose the whole time... In "Granite State", faced with the realisation that all his actions were for nothing, Walt calls the DEA to give himself up... and then he sees the Schwartzes on TV, saying just the right thing to remind Walt why he felt bitter and angry enough to become Heisenberg in the first place. By the time the DEA shows up to arrest him, Walt is gone. Somewhat subverted when he actually gets back as it turns out he's becomes an admittedly dark Atoner.

Cliffhanger: A number of episodes, though only season 3 has come close to having the season finale variety. Probably the most dramatic one is at the end of the season 5 episode "To'hajiilee", when the episode ends with Hank and Gomez in a shoot-out with Jack and his men, in the middle of the desert with nobody to help them. The episode ending without a death probably conned a lot of viewers into assuming that Vince Gilligan would have killed them off at the end of the episode if he was going to do it, rather than at the start of the following episode... The mid-season finale for Season 5, "Gliding Over All," in which Hank at long last finds out that Walt is Heisenberg.

Coincidental Broadcast: In "Granite State", Walt has finally decided to turn himself in. Then he notices the bartender flipping through channels and sees an interview with his old partners, specifically talking about him. Keep in mind that this is the first TV broadcast he's seen in months, and that's the show that happens to be on.
Cold Open / The Teaser: A staple of the show. Many episodes open with a scene that is utterly fascinating, beautifully shot, almost a work of art in itself — and sometimes without a single word being spoken. Sometimes ends up being crucial to The Reveal for the episode (most recently in "Dead Freight"), or for the entire season (Season 2).
Concealment Equals Cover: Pretty thoroughly averted throughout the series. Probably the most notable example is the finale, wherein Walt kills off nearly all the Aryan Brotherhood group with an M60 parked outside the building they were in. The trope is possibly played straight in the Tuco/Hank shootout, although Tuco was wounded (and firing a rifle one-handed), and both were firing pretty wildly at first.
Confess to a Lesser Crime: In the first season, Skyler confronts Walt about his odd behavior and consorting with Jesse Pinkman. He tells her he's been buying pot from Pinkman. She immediately confronts Pinkman at his house.Jesse: And why'd you go and tell her I was selling you weed? Walt: Because somehow it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man. At the beginning of the second season, Walt confesses to changing the channel on Tio's soaps rather than attempting to poison Tuco. Skyler explains away all of Walt's bizarre behavior and sudden, inexplicable funds with an elaborate lie about a card counting spree in underground casinos. In Season 5, Walt lets Marie know about Skyler's affair with Ted, so that it would appear that she was stressing about Ted's visit to the hospital, and not Walt's descent into ruthlessness. Walt threatens to do this later in the fifth season to get Hank off his back: he confesses (on a videotape) to being the methamphetamine cook who created and produced Blue Sky... on the orders of Hank Schrader, the real Heisenberg, who used what he learned as a DEA agent to create a successful meth empire.

Continuity Nod: The teddy bear eye in season 2, and Walt's method for disposing of a body with acid in the season 4 premiere. A number of subtle ones emerge in "Gliding Over All": The Cold Open features a close up of a fly not unlike the cold open of the episode "Fly" (with which this episode shares a writer). The ricin vial that Walt hid back in "Madrigal" makes an appearance. Walt has a bandage on his wrist, covering the burn he gave himself two episodes ago. In a run-down hotel room we see a copy of the same painting that Walt looks at while getting treatment for cancer. We see all nine of Mike's hazard pay recipients in prison as they are getting murdered. The paper towel holder that Walt punched repeatedly at the end of "4 Days Out" back in Season 2. Gale's Walt Whitman obsession and the letters W.W. "Blood Money" has a whole slew of them when Hank goes over case files while trying to piece together an investigation against Walt. Among the case files we see a slew of photographs of many dead past characters as well as the the surveillance tape of Walt and Jesse stealing methylamine back at the end of Season 1. Walt's pants (which he ditched in the desert in the pilot episode) make an appearance in "Ozymandias" as Walt is rolling the barrel across the desert. In "Felina", after retrieving the ricin, Walt stands in the middle of his now-wrecked living room, on the exact same spot where he first got the idea to cook meth two years before. Walt's appearance during the latter half of "Felina" (full head of hair, green shirt, white undershirt, beige pants and jacket) mirrors his appearance in the pilot.

Contrived Coincidence: Everything involving the midair collision in the Season 2 finale. In Season 2, Jesse's friend Combo gets killed by Tomás. In Season 3, Jesse's new girlfriend Andrea turns out to be Tomás's sister. In "Granite State", just moments after Walt decides to turn himself in to the police, he just so happens to turns his attention to a television interview of Gretchen and Elliot minimizing his role in the founding of Grey Matter Technology, which angers him so much, he decides to resurrect Heisenberg one more time. In "Felina", Lydia phones Todd moments after Walt has killed all the neo-Nazis. Walt picks up the phone and tells her he's poisoned her. There'd be no other way of her (and the viewers) learning this.

Corrupt the Cutie: Skyler is a straight arrow in Season 1, but as Walt's behavior is revealed to her, she engages in increasingly sketchy business dealings, shows herself to be a talented money-launderer, and even advocates murdering Jesse when he becomes a direct threat to their family.
"Could Have Avoided This!" Plot: Walt almost immediately realizes this about the tense showdown with Mike Ehrmantraut that ends in the latter's death. As soon as he calms down, it occurs to him that he could have gotten the names he wanted from Lydia, who was the one who wanted them dead in the first place.
Cradle of Loneliness: After Jane's death, Jesse can be seen cradling his cell phone, then calling her number just to hear her speaking on her voice mail, until her line is finally disconnected. Walt still holds on to his wedding ring during his time of isolation in the middle of New Hampshire. When it doesn't fit his finger anymore due to the chemotherapy and harsh living conditions, he ties it around his neck.
Walt still holds on to his wedding ring during his time of isolation in the middle of New Hampshire. When it doesn't fit his finger anymore due to the chemotherapy and harsh living conditions, he ties it around his neck.
Creature of Habit: Lydia, who always sits at the same table in the same cafe at the same time and day every week, and orders the same drink and insists on the same brand of sweetener. This turns out to be a Fatal Flaw; Walt is able to arrange her death just by replacing a single packet of Stevia with ricin.
Crocodile Tears Walt tells Hank a sob story about his marriage and fakes tears, reckoning that Hank will contrive a reason to leave for a moment while Walt composes himself. When Hank goes to bring them both coffee, Walt plants bugs in his office. Used by Walt again masterfully in Season Five's "Confessions" in a recording to be released in the event of his death, to blatantly implicate Hank as the mastermind behind Heisenberg.

Cutlery Escape Aid: There is a man stealing the fragment of a plate to escape.
Cut Lex Luthor a Check We establish pretty early on that Walter is a highly competent chemist, with the knowledge necessary to help found a highly successful high tech startup, who has a chip on his shoulder about being having to settle for a modest life as a science teacher. So, it's a bit strange that in the 20 years or so between cashing out of his start up and being diagnosed with cancer it apparently never occurred to him to become a chemical engineer or something, which would be well within his competency, stable, and probably well paying enough to satisfy his ego (at least Season 1 Walter's ego, anyways). Adding to this, his co-founders from his highly successful startup do, quite literally, offer to write him a check at one point Gus owns quite a few legitimate businesses that would see him living quite comfortably on their own. The fact that he must "hide in plain sight" means that he cannot actually spend all the millions that he's raking in through his illegal meth trade. What's the point of it, then? A flashback episode in season 4 suggests that his entire meth enterprise has been fueled out of a desire for revenge against the cartels that murdered his partner and humiliated him. Walter lampshades this when commenting on Gale's amazing coffee-making skills:Walt: Why the hell are we making meth? In Season 5, now that the Cartel and Gus are both gone and the Whites own a prosperous car wash (and more cash than they can reasonably launder through it in years), Walt could just quit. He doesn't, emphasizing how far his priorities have changed.

Dark Reprise: When Walter calls the DEA from the bar in New Hampshire, the opening theme returns, sounding quite a bit darker than it usually did.
A Day in the Limelight: Before he was solidified as basically being the show's co-lead Jesse gets a lot of focus in season 1's "Cancer Man" which goes into his home life and family background more than any episode up to that point. "Peekaboo" also counts for Jesse. "Negro Y Azul" in Season 2 and "One Minute" in Season 3 for Hank. "Open House" features an oddly heavy amount of focus on Marie. "Hermanos" in Season 4 for Gus. The episode focuses more on him than any other character and gives a look into his Mysterious Past and provides a lot of subtext for his relationship with the Cartel, Tio in particular. "Madrigal" features a lot of Mike being a badass. "Fifty One" is this for Skyler. Unsurprisingly, it is also the episode that won Anna Gunn her Emmy. "Better Call Saul" obviously serves as a day in the limelight for Saul, and to a lesser extent, Badger.
"Hermanos" in Season 4 for Gus. The episode focuses more on him than any other character and gives a look into his Mysterious Past and provides a lot of subtext for his relationship with the Cartel, Tio in particular.
Deadly Euphemism: In "Buried", when Saul wants to suggest that Walt have someone killed:Saul: Have you given any thought to sending him on a trip to Belize? Walt: Belize? Saul: Yeah. Belize. You know, where, uh, where Mike went to. Off on a trip to... Belize. In "Rabid Dog", Walt criticises Saul's mealy-mouthed circumlocutions in the area of having people killed; "You're full of colourful metaphors, aren't you, Saul. 'Belize', 'Old Yeller'..." Later in the same episode, Skyler has to clarify whether Walt is using these when he's talking about Jesse.Walt: I'm gonna... I'm gonna talk to him. Make him see reason. Skyler: Talk to him. Make him see reason. (beat) So, I'm clear... these are just euphemisms you're using here, right?

Death Montage: In "Gliding Over All",  there's a prison montage of the 9 "legacy" members of Gus' drug cartel being shanked or burned alive.
Deceased Fall-Guy Gambit: Walt has a chance to pin the whole "Heisenberg" thing on Gale... but alcohol and pride make him tell Hank that the guy doesn't seem like he's smart enough, and he must be working for someone else.
Defiant to the End: Even with an injured leg and Walt's pleadings to save his life from Jack, Hank refuses to take any of his offers and gets killed by Jack. Though he's likely right that it was going to end the same anyway.
Deliberate Values Dissonance: Hank's boisterous, wise-cracking personality can seem downright racist, sexist, classist, or otherwise politically incorrect all around; and yet, when the chips are down, he is a cop of true integrity and probably the most morally responsible character in the show. Until perhaps the second half of season five.
Despair Event Horizon: Walt seems to have reached one in the beginning of the episode "Salud", after getting the shit beaten out of him by his surrogate son Jesse. However, his real son helps him through it. He promptly returns to it in "Crawl Space", when he learns that Gus declared him and his family free game and all of the money they had was given to Ted Beneke by Skyler. The moment in season two when Walt learns that his cancer is in remission. Usually, this is incredible news, but for Walt, it's outright tragic, which Walt later explains to Jesse in "Fly". He would've much preferred if he succumbed to the cancer after his daughter's birth. It's implied that this ideal death would enable Walt to avoid any heavy consequences with his drug manufacturing, but with the remission, Walt will probably be alive a little longer than he assumed. Cue Walt beating his fists on a towel dispenser. It now seems that Walt has finally gone beyond the line of despair when in "Granite State", his son insults him multiple times for supposedly killing Hank and disowns him as a father, even when Walt tearfully begs him to receive the money he's giving to him through a conduit. He lets the DEA know about his location and stays a bit longer until his pride is hit by an appearance on Charlie Rose by Gray Matter in which they discuss his involvement in the company. He leaves immediately afterwards.

Destroy the Evidence: Several times in the show Walter will cover his tracks. It works, as even after Hank figures out that Walt is Heisenberg, he is unable to arrest him due to having only circumstantial evidence. That is, until he and Jesse trick Walt into confessing to multiple murders over the phone.
Diabolus ex Machina: Not related to the main plot, but honestly, can you say anything else about the end of "ABQ"? Fittingly for the trope, Vince Gilligan himself described it as a "Lucifer ex machina". Though it's obliquely foreshadowed by the first scene of the episode in which it happens, the discovery that some random kid saw the methylamine heist, followed immediately by seemingly mild-mannered Todd gunning the boy down is a horrifying left-field turn from Walt and Jesse's perspective.

Dies Wide Open: Jane starts choking when she's asleep. When she finally dies, her eyelids slide partially open. She's seen later with her eyes still open. Walt himself, in the closing shot of "Felina", lying on his back and staring at the ceiling of the Neo-Nazi meth lab.

Disc-One Final Boss: Tuco in season 2, the Cousins in season 3, Don Eladio in Season 4, Hank in season 5. Gus for the whole series.
Does This Remind You of Anything?: When Hank asks Walt to place a tracking bug on Gus's vehicle, he utters this remark:"Walt, don't make me beg here. Just stick it in there!" The scene where Jesse tries heroin for the first time plays out very much like he's losing his virginity. It even takes place on his bed, with his girlfriend.Jesse: [with breathless anticipation] What's it feel like? Jane: There's a chill, and then... You'll see. I'll meet you there... (They kiss, he gives her a small nod before she pushes the needle into his arm.) During the episode "Over," Walt finds fungus in the floorboards and becomes fixated on cutting out the rot before it undermines his home, which is practically a Literal Metaphor. In a show about the drug trade, much of Walt's character arc parallels the behavior of a drug addict. He starts out small, but begins gradually cooking progressively larger batches of meth, committing progressively more violent crimes, and sinking progressively deeper into the criminal underworld after discovers the thrill of being a meth cook. He starts out trying to rationalize his actions by claiming that he needs the money for legitimate reasons (first to leave money for his family, then to pay for cancer treatments), but those reasons eventually collapse after his cancer is cured, his family leaves him, and he ends up with more money than he can spend in a single lifetime. By the end of the show, he has ceased to cook meth for logical reasons, and only does it because he can't stop.
Double-Meaning Title: Many episodes. The titles "737", "Down", "Over", "ABQ" all refer to events within those episodes, but also foreshadow the plane crash. "Phoenix" is Jane's birthplace, the name of the Mars Lander shown on TV, a reference to Birth/Death Juxtaposition (Holly is born, Jane dies) and a Cross Referenced Title with "ABQ". "I See You" has Leonel recognising Walt and attempting to kill him, and also plays on the term "ICU". "Open House" has Jesse's open-house party and Marie's open-house viewings. "Shotgun" has Jesse riding shotgun for Mike, and being threatened with one by a stick-up guy. "Face-Off" has Gus' conflicts with both Walt and Tio Salamanca come to a head, and ends with half his head being blown away. "Buried" refers to both Walt burying his money at the To'hajiilee reservation, and Declan's buried meth lab in which Lydia takes shelter while Declan's crew is massacred. "Rabid Dog" makes an explicit parallel between Jesse Pinkman and Old Yeller... but also shows Hank continuing to act outside police protocol and betraying a more ruthless streak than we've seen from him before. The series finale "Felina" has a doozy. It's a reference to Marty Robbins' song "El Paso" (the song playing on Walt's car radio in the opening scene), which is about a cowboy who dies in his lover's arms after being gunned down by his enemies. It's also an anagram of "Finale", and a sly reference to the chemical formula "FeLiNa" ("Iron, Lithium, and Sodium", which can be seen as shorthand for "Blood, Meth, and Tears").

It's a reference to Marty Robbins' song "El Paso" (the song playing on Walt's car radio in the opening scene), which is about a cowboy who dies in his lover's arms after being gunned down by his enemies. It's also an anagram of "Finale", and a sly reference to the chemical formula "FeLiNa" ("Iron, Lithium, and Sodium", which can be seen as shorthand for "Blood, Meth, and Tears").
Downer Ending: Season 2 ends with Jane dead, Jesse in rehab, Skyler leaving Walt, and the plane crash over Albuquerque. "Ozymandias" is a downer episode: Hank and Gomez are dead, all but one of Walt's money barrels has been taken by the Aryans, who have also taken Jesse into captivity and forced him to cook for them, and Walt has lost his family, and is forced to go into hiding alone.

Dragon Their Feet: Subverted. After Gus is killed, Mike's immediate reaction is to go kill Walt. He's talked out of it when Walt reveals there's evidence that could implicate them both which needs to be destroyed.
The Dreaded: By Season 5, Walt is feared by everyone who knows him as Heisenberg.Jesse: He's the devil!
Drink Order: Lydia, a creature of routine, always orders tea with the exact same ingredients. Her habit becomes her undoing.
Driven to Suicide: In a season 3 episode it is revealed to Walt and the audience that Donald Margolis shot himself after the death of his daughter Jane and subsequent mid-air collision caused by this distraction. We never find out if he survives the attempt. After Gus Fring was murdered, the DEA began investigating Madrigal Electromotive. Peter Schuler, a criminal business partner, committed suicide by sticking one end of a defibrillator in his mouth and the other over his heart. Skyler attempts to drown herself in the pool when she becomes too terrified of Walt. Walt actually attempts suicide near the end of the very first episode, when his capture by police seems imminent. It's only his unfamiliarity with firearms that saves him, and thus dooms all of his future victims.

Skyler attempts to drown herself in the pool when she becomes too terrified of Walt.
Drunk with Power: After killing Gus, Walt feels invincible, as if he can do no wrong.
Drugs Are Bad: A major theme of the show, but not exactly the Aesop conveyed. Walter makes a deal with the devil to provide for his family after his death with drug money. As a result, he becomes a hardened murderer and manipulator, his relationship with his family is irreparably damaged, and his brother-in-law is nearly killed (and later on, actually gets killed). Jesse, for his part, loses his family, kills a person, gets his girlfriend killed, gets another girlfriend killed, and almost dies several times. Jesse's addiction and attempts to cope with his suffering also locks him into a downward spiral. Drugs are also seen having a destructive effect on various minor characters throughout the show. On the flip side, Jesse in particular can keep his drug habit while still functioning, and Gale Boetticher, a drug manufacturer, maintains a very neat lifestyle. Generally, its not the drugs themselves that bring the characters downfall, but all of the criminal activity and dishonesty and physical danger that comes with it and using them to the point of inability to function that do.
Dying Moment of Awesome: Héctor Salamanca of all people gets one, giving Gus one last look of hate before blowing them all up. Hank's absolute refusal to accept Walt's attempts to save his life, and final words of "My name is ASAC Schrader. And you can go fuck yourself" followed shortly by "Do what you're going to.." before being shot through the head. Mike: "Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace." Gus walks out of the room where a bomb has gone off, calmly straightens his tie — and falls over dead with half of his face burned down to the skull.

Mike: "Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace."
Gus walks out of the room where a bomb has gone off, calmly straightens his tie — and falls over dead with half of his face burned down to the skull.
The Dying Walk: The show loved this trope. Gus walks out of the room after it was blown up and then adjusts his tie so he can Face Death with Dignity, Mike walks away from the spot where Walter shot him and finds a peaceful place to die, and Walt walks away from his final confrontation with the Nazis and goes to the nearby chemistry lab (chemistry labs having been the place where he was probably always happiest in his life) and dies there.
MacGyvering: Walt often uses his chemistry to solve practical problems. Thermite made using the aluminum powder from an Etch-a-Sketch. A makeshift battery made from sponges, bolts and brake pads was pure grade-A vintage MacGyvering. A bomb mostly made from stuff he's got lying around. Extracting ricin from castor beans. Walt creates an electrical arc from live wires for a coffee pot to cut through a plastic handcuff keeping him attached to a radiator. It works, but not without a nasty burn on his wrist. In "Felina," Walt constructs an automatic turret gun, using a garage door opening mechanism to sweep the gun back and forth and his car's remote key as a trigger switch.

Machiavelli Was Wrong: Subverted by Gus. He doesn't believe in using fear as a motivator as Mike suggests. Unless he comes to see you as a dangerous liability who can only be controlled that way.
Manic Pixie Dream Girl: In Season 2, Jesse meets a low-key MPDG in the form of Jane, a tattoo artist with a serious drug history. She's considerably more subdued and less manic than most examples, and she encourages him to cut back on the drugs in addition to getting him to embrace art. Then she demonstrates the dark side of this trope when she backslides on her own sobriety, gets Jesse into harder drugs (and given that he started out as a methhead, that's saying something), and ultimately reveals herself (at least while using) to be greedy, manipulative, and self-destructive.  Then she chokes on her own vomit thanks to Walt.
Meaningful Echo: In Walt's Despair Event Horizon in "4 Days Out", he says that he deserves this. In "ABQ", while Jesse is suffering a DEH of his own following Jane's death, he says the same thing and refers back to its original use in the former episode, now knowing its meaning.
Meaningful Name: Walter White: 'Walter' means 'Ruler of the people'. Walt does say he's in the 'empire business'. "Heisenberg", as in "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle". Considering all the uncertainties surrounding Walter White and that persona, it's a good bet the writers had that in mind. Werner Heisenberg also worked for the Nazi nuclear weapon program during WWIInote Werner Heisenberg was very definitely not a Nazi and took the job at least partly because being in charge of the project to develop nuclear weapons seemed to him to be a really good way to ensure that the project didn't actually develop nuclear weapons and Walt works with a group of neo-Nazis in season 5. In Season 1 episode 6, "Crazy Handful of Nothin,'" when Walt meets Jesse's friends at a science museum to plan distribution, Heisenberg and nuclear bomb-related history are depicted in the background. Walt improvs the name when he confronts Tuco and is ready to blow everyone up with the mercury fulminate. Skyler White: 'Skyler' derives from the Dutch surname 'Schuyler', meaning 'student' or 'scholar'. Skyler learns to be comfortable with crime from Walt, and eventually becomes a far better liar than him. Walter White Junior: Doesn't have a name of his own, nor a characterization beyond loving breakfast. Flynn: derives from 'O'Floin', meaning 'son of Floin', which itself derives from 'flann', meaning 'red'. So, perhaps, 'Son of one with blood on his hands'? Hank Schrader: 'Hank' is a shortening of 'Henry', which means 'Ruler of his Home', possibly indicating his standing on the side of the law, as well as his high rank, and nicely contrasting Walter's 'ruler of the people'. Jesse Pinkman: 'Jesse' means 'gift from God', perhaps highlighting his more virtuous nature. Saul Goodman: 'Saul' means 'called for' or 'asked for'. Fits his role quite well. Saul Goodman's name is pronounced like "'S all good, man!" This may be intentional on Saul's part, as he tells Walter that his real surname is McGill, and he changed it to something more Jewish-sounding to appeal to Albuquerque's criminal underclass. Spinoff series Better Call Saul confirms that this was intentional on Saul's part. From the title card, Bromine is "a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature [and] corrosive and toxic" and Barium is used in X-Rays and turns fire green. Beneke Fabricators, a company which we later learn is involved in large-scale tax fraud. Fabricators is the key word. Gray Matter has two. One being named after a tissue that makes up part of the brain, the other being a combination of the founders' names; Elliot Schwartz and Walter White. "Schwartz" is German for "black", black + white = gray.

Mega Corp.: The German company Madrigal Electromotive, which owns Los Pollos Hermanos and the laundromat hiding the superlab. Walt co-founded (then left) Grey Matter, which became a huge company worth $2 billion.
Men Are the Expendable Gender: Male recurring characters who die during the course of the series? Too many to count. Female recurring characters who die in the course of the series? Only three; Jane Margolis, Andrea Cantillo, and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.
Mexican Standoff: In "To'hajiilee", between Hank and Gomez, and Uncle Jack's heavily tooled-up crew.
Miranda Rights: Hank tells Walt his rights after he arrests Walt in "To'hajiilee". Walt's only response is calling Jesse a "coward".
Money Is Not Power: Invoked in season 5B when Walt offers Jack eighty-million dollars to spare Hank's life. It obviously doesn't work.
Monochrome Casting: Given that the most prominent Hispanic characters on the show (Gus, several of his dealers and subordinates, and almost all of the Cartel) are dead by the end of season four, the cast of season five consists exclusively of white Americans, with the sole exception of Gomez, who only appears in a handful of episodes. The primary antagonists even happen to be a neo-Nazi organization, which naturally precludes much racial diversity.
Mood Whiplash: So, so much. The show goes from comedy to tragedy and back at the drop of a hat. Probably the harshest example to date is in season 5's "Dead Freight"; it's mostly a pretty fun episode that sees the guys pulling off a brilliant train heist, for methylamine, conceived in such a way that no innocents have to be killed and they won't even know the train was robbed, the execution of it is one of the most intense, suspenseful moments in the show's history. Everything, just barely, goes off without a hitch, leaving the characters and the audience feeling relieved. Then they see that a young boy has been watching them for who knows how long. Newbie Todd calmly pulls out a gun and kills the kid without batting an eye.

Moral Event Horizon: In-universe, Skyler feels that Walt has crossed the line in "Ozymandias" when she thinks that Walt killed Hank despite his attempts in explaining that he tried to save him.
More Dakka: Jack and his Nazi buddies believe in this wholeheartedly. And it's how they die.
Mortal Wound Reveal: In the Season 4 finale, after Héctor sets off a bomb that obliterates his room and everything inside, Gus strangely steps out seemingly unharmed. After Gus casually adjusts his tie, the camera pans around to reveal he's missing a decent amount of his face and head, and then he promptly drops dead. This is also how we discover the bullet wound which kills Heisenberg.
This is also how we discover the bullet wound which kills Heisenberg.
Motivational Lie: In the season 4 finale: Walt convinces Jesse that Gus tried to poison a child with ricin to get Jesse on his side.
My God, What Have I Done?: When Walt realizes that he was responsible for the plane crash... Tuco has this reaction when he realizes he's just killed one of his henchmen. Walter has the reaction of this after shooting (and ultimately killing) Mike over a fit of rage just because Mike had told him off in a argument. Jesse spends all of season 4 feeling this after murdering Gale. Saul seems horrified when he learns Walt used him to help poison a kid.

Neat Freak Gus, who obsessively prioritizes keeping his clothes neat to inappropriate levels. The most ridiculous examples include carefully laying down a towel and organizing himself before vomiting up a lethal poison about to kill him in "Salud," and adjusting his tie after being caught in a bomb blast in "Face Off." Walt has bouts of this when the pressure of his criminal double life gets to him, fixating on the rotten boards in his house in "Over" and a fly in the lab in "Fly". Lydia, making her a comical Fish out of Water when examining Declan's filthy underground meth lab.

Newscaster Cameo: Ashleigh Banfield in the third season and Charlie Rose in the fifth. The newscaster who reports on Gus's death at the end of the fourth, Antoinette Antonio, is a local morning radio host.
Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!: Another big element of the show. Most of Walt's actions have consequences he is unable to foresee in any way — like the plane crash or the Cousins eventually coming after Hank — and they often end up messing up the situation even more. One of the best examples of this is the season 5 premiere, where Walt takes a giant magnet to destroy Gus' laptop at a police evidence warehouse. In the ensuing chaos, a photo breaks, revealing bank accounts meant to silence everyone involved in the operation. Plus the pull of the magnet tipping over their own truck. Jesse in "Granite State." While being forced to cook for Todd and Jack, there's a picture of Andrea and Brock taped on a wall in the lab, as if to say "If you fuck up, they're dead." So naturally, when Jesse is caught trying to escape Jack's compound, he's promptly driven to Andrea's house to watch her execution.

No-Holds-Barred Beatdown: Tuco is very fond of this. In season 3, Hank does this to Jesse. In season 4, Mike does this to Walter. Also in season 4, Jesse delivers a particularly brutal one to Walt. In the season 5 episode "Confessions," Jesse gives one to Saul after he finds out that Walt poisoned Brock.

Noodle Incident: Something that happened on a 4th of July weekend at Gretchen's father's place precipitated Walt and Gretchen's falling out and Walt's departure from Gray Matter. There is the vague suggestion of a Love Triangle of some sorts, as a flashback scene shows Walt and Gretchen engaging in some heavy flirting, while in the main time frame of the story Gretchen is married to Elliott. This incident was later explained by Vince Gilligan, saying that Walt felt inferior to Elliott and Gretchen and left because of those feelings. Walter also lost a job at Los Alamos for an unknown reason. In fact, the show never explains how a chemist of his talents wound up teaching high school chemistry. Gus's history in Chile causes the cartel to spare him, even though they just killed his partner in front of him.

Not So Different: In "Rabid Dog", it becomes clear that Hank is toying with other people's lives just like Walt did. In "Rabid Dog" as well, Skyler has become comfortable with murder as well, pushing Walt to murder Jesse.

Object Tracking Shot / Epic Tracking Shot: After the plane crash in "ABQ", we see a long, 20-second OTS from the perspective of the pink teddy bear, heading straight for Walt's pool.
The Obstructive Love Interest: Jane Margolis (played by Krysten Ritter) is this to Jesse — let's count the ways: Getting Jesse addicted to heroin and thus making him useless as Walt's partner for a few episodes towards the end of Season 2. Jane gets Jesse high on heroin during Season 2 Episode 11; as a result, Jesse misses the funeral for his murdered friend "Combo" and Walt has to deliver the meth himself (missing his own daughter's birth while doing so). Due to Jesse being on heroin and thus useless to him, Walt keeps all the meth profits to himself, but when Jane finds out about this, she threatens Walt with exposure to the media if Walt does not hand over half the profits to Jesse (read: not to Jesse, but to Jane). Jane's father Don catches her and Jesse doing heroin and is one step away from calling the cops to arrest them, before giving her one last chance. Jane plans on using Jesse's meth money so that she can escape her father and Jesse can escape Walt by fleeing to New Zealand, but shares one last dose of heroin with Jesse, which gives her an expectable death of unconsciously choking on her own vomit. Waking up next to Jane's corpse the next day scars Jesse forever and means that Walt has to get him to rehab.

Offscreen Inertia: At a Q&A session at a public screening of the finale, Vince Gilligan joked that Huell is still sitting in that hotel room.
Oh, Crap!: Walt and Jesse when they discover that Krazy-8 wasn't killed by the phosphine gas. Walt when he finds out that Jesse dissolved Emilio's body in a ceramic bathtub, and then again for both of them when the sloppy remains crash through the ceiling. Gus noticing that Tio's bell isn't chiming properly, because the clapper's been replaced with a bomb that he's just triggered. Quite literally when Walt remembers Gus had a CCTV camera in the superlab that he and Jesse previously destroyed, the same one that is now crawling with DEA agents. Both literally and figuratively in "Gliding Over All" when Hank finally discovers that Walt is Heisenberg thanks to some light reading while on the toilet. Hank and Marie in "Confessions" as they watch Walter's Thanatos Gambit Confession Cam tape implicate them in his crimes. Lydia, when Walt informs her that he laced the Stevia that she always takes with her tea with ricin. The whole show is really a non-stop string of Oh, Crap! moments. The famed "I am the one who knocks speech" has a subtle example of this. Skyler is panicking after she hears about Gale's murder and trying to get Walt to go to the police. Walt stands up and gives a very impassioned speech about how he is not in danger and is in fact a person to be feared. It's only at the end, after he delivers what has become his Signature Line, that he gets a quick look of uncertainty on his face, realizing he's pretty much given away to Skyler that he's the one responsible for Gale's death. Also at this point, Skyler is having a pretty big Oh, Crap! of her own at the strong implication that her husband is a murderer.

Only Bad Guys Call Their Lawyers: Gus tries to avert suspicion from himself in Season 4 by coming to answer questions from the DEA without a lawyer present. Mike also waives his right to have an attorney present when questioned by Hank and Gomez in "Madrigal". In "Buried", Hank's attempt to invoke this trope is what causes Skyler to realize he's more interested in catching Walt than protecting her.

Out-of-Character Moment: At least one critic said that he thought the biggest misstep in the entire series was Walter abruptly deciding to give up his meth business and Skyler welcoming him back into the family in "Gliding Over All", both moments seeming extremely incongruous with their behaviour up to that point in the series. Another critic found fault with Walt's having become The Atoner by the final episode of the series, believing that the transformation in his character wasn't adequately depicted nor explained.

Papa Wolf: Do not make fun of Walter Jr. in front of his dad. The way that Walter Sr. put that Jerk Jock on his ass and delivered the poetic justice "having trouble walking?" line was a true Crowning Moment of Awesome. Walt does not take kindly to threats against his family. Gus threatened to kill his son and infant daughter. Two episodes later, he got half of his face blown off with a pipe bomb.
Walt does not take kindly to threats against his family. Gus threatened to kill his son and infant daughter. Two episodes later, he got half of his face blown off with a pipe bomb.
Past Victim Showcase: Gus Fring likes to screw with Tio Salamanca's head, even going as far as personally delivering Don Eladio's Ojo de Dios pendant to him after killing him in "Salud".
Pet the Dog: Walt and his relationship with Jesse. Jesse has a few moments too. Todd spares Walt's life, apologizes for his loss as genuinely as can be expected in the situation, and leaves him with one of his cash barrels. Granted, it is only eleven of Walt's hard-earned eighty million dollars, but Todd could simply ask his uncle to shoot Walt dead.

Plot Armor: Despite Anyone Can Die, this trope nevertheless holds good for most of the series. None of the characters introduced in the first season get killed off until "Ozymandias", which sees Hank and Gomez killed by the neo-Nazis. Walt dies two episodes later. Every other major character survives the series.
Poisonous Friend: Very few relationships in this series operate without a dash of something iffy on one side or another. But, the biggest, most poisonous one you're probably ever likely to see in detail in any medium can be found between Walter and Jesse. Each manages to be a detrimental influence on the other in different ways, although the balance of power is usually in Walter's hands (but, not exclusively so). Their relationship is so poisonous, it has a incidental body count of its own well into triple figures when you tot up the lives lost in a related air accident, let alone all the other lives left ended or just wrecked in its wake.
Poor Communication Kills: When Gonzo gets himself killed, the DEA raids Tuco's headquarters. Walt and Jesse incorrectly believe that Tuco is killing any witness to No Doze's murder, while Tuco believes that Gonzo disappeared and sold him out. As a result, Walt and Jesse make a plan to kill Tuco, while Tuco kidnaps Walt and Jesse and wants them to go to Mexico with him to cook Meth. The only reason Mike dies in Season 5. Marie warns Hank about this in Season 5 when he's investigating Walt solo, without telling the department. If the DEA catches up to Walt, Hank will look complicit; she doesn't point out that if Walt comes after Hank, he and Marie are the only ones who know his secret.

Precision F-Strike: Occasionally used despite being blanked out for broadcast on basic cable. Word of God states that they were only allowed one f-bomb per season (or half season), so each instance was placed specifically to fit this trope. In the pilot, Walt delivers one to Bogdan when he quits the car wash: "Fuck you and your eyebrows!" In "Crazy Handful of Nothin'", after Walt demonstrates his fulminated mercury is not meth: "ARE YOU FUCKIN' NUTS?!" Early in the same episode: "Oh, come on, Jesus! Just grow some fucking balls!" In "Peekaboo", Walt says "fuck you" to Gretchen. "I.F.T": "I fucked Ted." "Bug": "Get the fuck out of here and never come back." "Face Off": "F-U-C-" "Say My Name" "Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace." "Ozymandias": My name is ASAC Schrader, and you can go fuck yourself. "Granite State": "I'm not doing  one more cook for you psycho fucks!"
"Ozymandias": My name is ASAC Schrader, and you can go fuck yourself.
"Granite State": "I'm not doing  one more cook for you psycho fucks!"
Pre-Mortem One-Liner: A somewhat humorous example; in "Fly", Walt quips "Say goodnight" right as he's about to hit the fly...only for all of the lights in the superlab to go out when Jesse shuts off the main circuit breaker to the lab.
Pride: Walt's cardinal sin. He insists on making his money illegally rather than swallowing his pride and accepting charity from an estranged former colleague. He also takes too much pride in his meth-cooking skill, to the point that he risks his own safety several times to ensure that Heisenberg's reputation as the best meth cook around remains untarnished and intact. Hank is on the verge of accepting that Gale was Heisenberg when Walt, not wanting Gale to get the credit for his own work, actually convinces Hank that he may have just been a subordinate and Heisenberg could still be out there. Pride ends up killing Jack and his men when Jack insists on disproving Walt's accusation that Jesse is his partner rather than his slave. This distraction allows Walt to recover the trigger to his remote machine gun.

Pyrrhic Victory: Walt manages to build a massive nest egg for his children, but he has effectively destroyed his family in the process. Hank is dead, their house is gone, and Walt Jr. and Skyler don't want him around anymore.
Pyrrhic Villainy: Walt's obsession with amassing wealth to help his family slowly disintegrates his family over the course of the show. This is brought to the fore with the flashes forward in the fifth season, showing how Walt's life is ruined and he's completely alone.
Radish Cure: In "Box Cutter," the season 4 premiere, when Victor reveals that he has learned how to make Walt's meth and is ready to replace him if need be, and Gus responds by violently killing Victor in front of Walter. Gus does this in reponse to Walt having killed Gale at the end of season 3, showing Walt that if he wants to gain personal security through murder and violence, that's exactly what he'll get.
Reality Ensues: Many, many examples. Everything from an undercover cop abusing the myth that police must tell them that they are cops if directly asked to a bunch of cops were blown up by a bomb stuffed into a tortoise. This show likes to use reality to beat its audience into a bloody pulp. "Ozymandias" is this trope to the whole series. As Walt finds out too late, you can't deal drugs without ruining your family. Doesn't matter how good he's proved at Batman Gambit or Xanatos Speed Chess or Indy Ploy, Walt can't do anything to stop Uncle Jack and his Aryan crew from taking his eighty million dollars for themselves. They have guns and he doesn't. Hits especially hard in "Granite State": In the previous episode, when Walt called Skyler as the police listened in, he played himself up as a tyrannical druglord who scared Skyler into working with him, thus ensuring the police won't think of her as a willing accomplice. Unfortunately, when Walt flees from New Mexico, the fact that she has no idea where he is means the DEA will still prosecute her. All this on top of the fact that his family will forever be haunted by his crimes and his home and whatever he wasn't able to take with him has been RICO'd by the authorities.

"The Reason You Suck" Speech: A rather unexpected one by Saul's secretary, a background character who had barely said two words throughout the entire show: "Your partner and you are in danger?! Whoop-di-freaking-do! Why do you think Saul is not here? And how is this news, exactly? The two of you being in danger?! After doing something idiotic! You are such a pain in my ass, you know that? You're the reason I got to go on unemployment for god knows how long. I was at least looking forward to getting out of here in the next half hour, but noooo!!! Now I got to wait around all day for a plate glass guy to fix this door!" Mike delivers a whirlwind one to Walt near the end of "Say My Name", complete with pointing out his Fatal Flaw. Walt takes it about as well as you would expect, and it seems to be what pushes him over the edge to shoot Mike. "All of this falling apart is on you. We had a good thing, you stupid son of a bitch! We had Fring, we had a lab, we had everything we needed, and it all ran like clockwork. You could have shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed! It was perfect, but no. You just had to blow it up. You, and your pride and your ego!" The speech Hank dishes to Walt at the end of "Blood Money" is nothing short of this."You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass. You bombed a nursing home. Heisenberg. Heisenberg! You lying, two-faced sack of shit!" Walter Junior to Skyler, after her banalities about the seat belt: "You're shittin' me, right? If all this is true and you knew about it, then — then you're as bad as him!" Junior to Walt in "Granite State", when Walt tries to send him money:"...you killed Uncle Hank! YOU KILLED HIM! What you did to Mom, you asshole! You killed Uncle Hank-Just shut up! Just shut up! YOU KILLED UNCLE HANK! YOU KILLED HIM! What you did-just shut up! SHUT UP! Will you just-just leave us alone, you asshole! Why are you still alive?! Why don't you just-just die already?! JUST DIE!"

Redemption Equals Death: Walt, after making amends with Jesse and Skyler, plans to end his life this way by letting the former shoot him. After he refuses, and noticing the bullet in his torso, Walt instead bleeds out and dies in the Neo-Nazi meth lab. It's not a perfect example, as he is noticeably unapologetic about his decisions throughout the series.
Red Herring: Until the series finale, ricin has not been used to successfully kill a single person since it was introduced all the way back in season 2. It got a lot of false starts though. When the DEA first looks into Gus Fring, Hank notes that they can't find anything at all about him before he emigrated from Chile to Mexico in 1986. Later, Mike and Gus discuss the possibility of the feds finding out about Gus's background. It seems as if this will be a plot point. It never is. When Walt arranges for he and Jesse to discuss Brock's poisoning, Jesse sees a bald man in the distance who he thinks is a hitman. It's actually just a bystander.

Refuge in Audacity: After Jesse tries to donate his drug earnings to Mike's granddaughter, Walt attempts to dissuade him by insisting that Mike is "perfectly capable of taking care of his own granddaughter." Of course, Walt killed Mike and evaporated his body with hydrofluoric acid. Walt must know that Jesse can see through this, because he spends quite a while pleading for Jesse to believe him despite his well-deserved reputation for being a Consummate Liar. Walt's "confession" he gives Hank, reframing everything he did as "Heisenberg" as being on Hank's orders. It's a very consummate form of blackmail. Gus is a prominent pillar of the community and a friend to the local police and DEA. After the murder attempt on Hank, he even donates free chicken to all the officers in the hospital.

Released to Elsewhere: After Walter kills Mike he lies to Jesse and tells him that Mike left town safely. Well, actually he didn't lie, when Jesse asked about Mike Walt said that he was "gone".
Retirony: Inverted with Hank in season 3. Played straight with Mike in season 5.
Sarcastic Confession: In the 3rd season premiere, brother-in-law Hank is helping Walter move out of his home after a falling out with his wife. One black duffel bag is heavy, and Walter isn't supposed to do any heavy lifting. Hank insists, and feels the heft. "What have you got in there, cinder blocks?" Without a drop of Irony, Walter replies, "Half a million dollars in cash." Hank only chuckles and says, "That's the spirit." It happens again in season four, when Hank jokingly speculates that the "W.W." dedication in Gale Boetticher's notebook stands for "Walter White", to which Walt "confesses". Hank flashes back to this moment in Season 5, when he finds a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass book with a dedication from "G.B." to "my other favourite W.W." in Walt's bathroom. Only this time, he's not laughing. A version occurs in the mid-season 5 finale, where Lydia says that she's afraid to give Walt the list of the 10 people who need to be killed, because if she does that, Walt has no use for her anymore. Walt responds, mocking her: "So, you put that list in my hands, and in your mind, I immediately just murder you? Right here in this restaurant, right here in this public place?!" As it turns out, that's exactly what he was planning (killing her with poison).

Sean Connery Is About to Shoot You: The final shot of season 3 has Jesse pointing the gun at Gale from an angle, but it gradually pans so that Jesse is pointing the gun at the camera just as he fires.
Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Walt is paranoid when working with Gus that he has listening bugs planted throughout the superlab. After falling out of Gus's favor by having Gale killed, Gus does one better and sets up surveillance cameras in the lab.
Series Fauxnale: Season 4's ending. While the show's writers knew that it'd probably be coming back for a fifth season, there was just enough doubt lingering over a renewal that they decided to wrap up the major story arcs that had been going until that point, while leaving plenty of avenues open for future stories.  If you do truly want a Happy Ending of this show, it is highly recommended to stop here.
Sexy Discretion Shot: In "Green Light", we hear Skyler moaning as she has sex with Ted for the second time as the camera pans over a series of photos, but on the last photo, you can just make out a blurry reflection of Skyler riding Ted.
Shoot the Dog: In "Ozymandias",  a thoroughly-compromised Walt drops almost completely into his Heisenberg persona in his last call to Skyler, which it's implied he knows is being monitored by the police. He yells at her and abuses her worse than he ever has in the series, coming across as a deranged psychopath, but in doing so he also takes the full weight for everything that's happened, absolving Skyler of her complicity in his crimes and making her look like far more of a straightforward victim.
Shout-Out: Walter's choice of that black porkpie hat might have been inspired from Gene Hackman. Juan Bolsa: Juan is Spanish for John. Bolsa means "bag" in Spanish. John + Bag = "Johnny Sack". The name of the last episode of season one is "A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal", after a line from Fargo. Looking for a weapon, Jesse walks along a set of shelves picking up progressively more intimidating implements, like Butch in Pulp Fiction. Guess they were out of katanas. Another Pulp Fiction reference: the season four premiere ends with Walt and Jesse getting breakfast in a diner, wearing t-shirts after their other clothes got covered in Victor's blood. Ted bangs his head on a table, sending several oranges falling onto his body. In the flash-forward that opens "Blood Money", Carol the neighbor drops a grocery bag full of oranges after seeing Walt again. Remember that the presence of oranges in The Godfather indicated when someone was about to have their day messed up. Vince Gilligan stated that his goal with Walter is to turn Mr. Chips into Scarface. In "Hazard Pay", Walt and his son watch the "say hello to my little friend" scene in Scarface. This might be setting up a later shout-out when we finally find out why Walt's buying that giant machine gun. The collar◊ on Walt's blue shirt in "Buyout" (the episode where he gives his "empire business" speech) is a bit larger than the ones he usually wears, a subdued resemblance to Tona Montana's flashy shirts. Walt's sitting pose during the dinner and living room scenes are also reminiscent of Tony's sitting pose◊. In season 5 episode "Dead Freight" there are actually shout outs to quite a few movies (and, cutely, the line "You've been watching too many movies"). Hank says they're going to watch Heat. Todd's murder of Drew Sharp at the end of the episode is like Waingro's execution of a guard during the armored car robbery. Mike's speech about having to kill witnesses is similar to Vincent Hanna's comment while investigating the armored car robbery scene about how Neil McCauley and his crew didn't hesitate for a second to kill the other two guards once Waingro shot the first guard, because "why leave a living witness?" The ending is also a double-shout out to Once Upon a Time in the West and The Great Train Robbery. A few more subtle shots here and there shout out to other films, such as High Noon. Saul compares his services to what Tom Hagen did for Vito Corleone. When Walter replies that he's no Vito, Saul retorts that Walt is Fredo. In telling Skyler not to talk to the cops (first or second episode of Season 5A), Saul says "When you talk to the cops, just be thinking one thing: Hogan's Heroes. Remember Sergeant Schultz?" [Skyler's blank look] "I see nothing! I know NOTHING!" When Jesse is sent to the hospital and badly mauled, Saul jokes about his bruised appearance by doing a reference to Rocky. In "Ozymandias", Hank's death is a reference to a similar death in The Wild Bunch, when Bishop kills a man in the middle of saying "Just do it alrea—" (or similar) From the same scene in "Ozymandias":  Hank claiming Jack made his decision "ten minutes ago" majorly parallels Adrian "Ozymandias" Veidt's infamous "thirty-five minutes ago" line in Watchmen. Both situations give a hopeless vibe to the characters desperate to stop a horrifying event from happening (Walt preventing Hank's death, and Rorschach/Night Owl preventing Ozymandias from killing half of New York's population)... only for those tragic events to happen anyway. In "Granite State", Charlie Rose, in his interview with Gretchen and Elliot Schwarz, mentions that Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote a New York Times column about Gray Matter's connection to Walt. Sorkin, who has called Breaking Bad his "favorite show", responded by writing an in-universe column about Gray Matter in Real Life. In the final Talking Bad, Vince says that in "Felina", Walt's final reaction to Jesse — of wanting to kill him, but then realizing that he still cares about him (by shielding him with his body) — was directly inspired by John Wayne's finally finding Natalie Wood's character in The Searchers. Additionally, Walt's final look at Junior — watching him walk back into the home that he (Walt) cannot ever go home to again — may also be an allusion to the final shot of the same film. Both Tuco's name and comically paranoid attitude is reminiscent to another Tuco we know. In "Problem Dog", Walt Jr. complains to Hank that he only had his Dodge Challenger for 15 hours. The bank used to deposit hazard pay for Gus's former employees is the Craddock Marine Bank, Fox Mulder's bank in several episodes of The X-Files, a series that Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan wrote 29 episodes for, and was a show runner. Walt assembling a remote-controlled mount for an automatic BFG in the middle of nowhere, then installing it in the trunk of a car, is quite similar to a certain signature scene in The Jackal.
Ted bangs his head on a table, sending several oranges falling onto his body.

Significant Anagram: The name of the last episode, "Felina", is not only an anagram of the word "Finale," but is also a shout-out to a song about a cowboy who returns to town when his lover Felina is captured, despite knowing he will be killed trying to rescue her.
Slapstick: Used infrequently. Jesse falling off the roof in season 1. Walt falling off of the lab catwalk in "Fly", slamming into a tank and then dropping to the concrete floor below. Ted Beneke tripping over a carpet, sliding across the polished floor and smashing head-first into a wall, with the camera lingering for quite some time on his prone body, then cutting to some of his fingers twitching slightly. Black Comedy at its finest.

Slavery Is a Special Kind of Evil: In a show full of all kinds of terrible people, the Neo-Nazi gang led by "Uncle" Jack is established as a Darker Shade of Black when they capture  Jesse and treat him as a slave, forcing him to cook meth in terrible conditions.
Somebody Set Up Us the Bomb: Gus Fring fails to realize that Hector's wheelchair has been rigged with a bomb until a moment before it detonates. Cue Oh, Crap! moment.
Soundtrack Dissonance: As befits a series with The X-Files ancestry, the show is quite fond of this trope. Used to great effect in "Half Measures," in which The Association's bouncy sunshine pop song "Windy" plays over a montage of Wendy the hooker's sad daily routine. In "Gliding Over All", a soft and gentle crooner song (Nat King Cole's "Pick Yourself Up") is played while several loose ends are being shanked in their jails. Even better: in the same episode, a cooking and dealing montage is set to Tommy James and the Shondells' peace'n'love anthem, "Crystal Blue Persuasion".

Spiteful Spit: Jesse spits in Walt's face after Walt, arrested and handcuffed by Hank in "To'hajiilee", calls him a coward.
Spousal Privilege: Brought up when Skyler decides to involve herself in Walt's criminal life. Deconstructed in "Granite State". Skyler is left by herself to face Walter's legal consequences, and if she doesn't comply with some info she will be held accountable to some degree despite Walt's phone call. Skyler has nothing to exchange and is seized of all assets, including her home and car wash business. In "Felina", Walt gives her the location of Hank and Gomez's dead bodies to trade for a deal with a prosecutor for clearance of the crimes.

Stuffed into the Fridge: Both of Jesse's girlfriends, Jane and Andrea, are killed off in order to sink Jesse into deeper depths of anguish: Jane by overdose, Andrea by getting shot in the head by Todd Alquist.
Suicide Dare: In the finale, Walter asks Jesse to kill him. Jesse doesn't oblige, and tells Walter he should do it himself. Walter doesn't, and spends some time in the lab while he bleeds out and Jesse escapes.
Taking the Heat: Edward James Kilkelly does this for money. ("The outside hasn't been too kind to old Jimmy.") Jesse took the heat for his younger over-achieving brother Jake after their housemaid found a joint that he smoked, and whose parents initially assumed it to be Jesse's. Posthumously, Gale. Hank starts to believe Gale was Heisenberg, which actually seems to piss Walt off to no end. Walt does this in a subtle manner in "Ozymandias" in his police tapped call towards Skyler when he claims that he committed all the crimes and built his own empire by himself, freeing her of any suspicion that she may have been involved in Walt's criminal activities.

Taking You with Me: Hector's final confrontation with Gus. In the finale, Walt's original intention when setting up the automatic machine gun to kill everyone in the supremacist gang's club house is this. Jesse is included in the count until Walt discovers what has been done to him. He tackles Jesse to the ground to distract the others and then activates the gun while shielding Jesse's body, taking a hit that eventually kills him.

Teeth-Clenched Teamwork: Walt and Jesse for the first few seasons. Later, Walt, Jesse, and Mike.
Tension-Cutting Laughter: Tuco is the master of this. Uncle Jack pulls it on Todd in "Granite State" when he asks him to spare Jesse's life. He stares him down, gun in hand, calling him a "piece of shit"... and then bursts out laughing and tousles his hair.

That Man Is Dead: An example of one character saying this about another. Gretchen Schwartz says during a television interview that while Heisenberg may still be out there, the Walter White she knew so many years ago is gone forever.
Theme Music Power-Up: A villainous example at the end of "Granite State": when Walt breaks out of his Despair Event Horizon by watching Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz insult his pride by claiming he had no hand in the success of Gray Matter, the extended intro theme kicks in and continues as we see the police close in on an empty bar.
There Are No Therapists: Walt is forced to see one after his fugue state incident, but it wasn't a psychological problem to begin with. After suffering a work-related trauma, Hank refuses to see a therapist, claiming that doing so would destroy his career. Skyler tells Marie that she is seeing a therapist, but that is a lie. The only aversion may be Marie herself, who says she sees a therapist for her kleptomania issues, but finds it frustrating that after discovering the truth about Walt, for Hank's sake she can't really share any of the details, without which there's not much she can say.
Those Two Guys: Badger and Skinny Pete become this starting in Season 3, after previously being two separate friends of Jesse. Huell and Kuby, Saul's "A-Team." The two Deadpan Snarker detectives that interrogate Jesse about Brock's poisoning in season 4 and again about the drug money he's been throwing away in season 5.
The two Deadpan Snarker detectives that interrogate Jesse about Brock's poisoning in season 4 and again about the drug money he's been throwing away in season 5.
Too Dumb to Live: Ted. When he gets audited by the IRS, he does almost nothing to try to cover up his embezzlements. When he gets lucky enough to get money to pay off his taxes, he decides to buy a new Mercedes instead. After he finds out where the money came from, he decides to not even use it, because apparently money from gambling is worse than embezzlement. Finally, he's rendered quadriplegic because he tripped on his own rug. Spooge, full stop... egging on his wife by ridiculing her as he works on cracking the ATM from the bottom with HIM UNDERNEATH isn't a very sound idea.
Trash the Set: Season 3 has Walt and Jesse crushing the RV, and Season 4 ends with them blowing up the laundromat superlab.
True Companions: Walt and Jesse, until season 5B."I've got this... nephew..." Jesse and Mike seem to have potential for this, until Walter kills Mike. Tuco, Tio, and The Cousins make up an evil version.
Walt and Jesse, until season 5B.
Jesse and Mike seem to have potential for this, until Walter kills Mike.
Unflinching Walk: The Cousins. No matter what's happening. Walt does one after blowing up KEN WINS's car. Gus does this after being the one to GET blown up. Gus also does this straight into a hail of bullets. He guesses correctly that the cartel gunmen don't want to kill him. Yet another one occurs right after Walt and Jesse blow up the superlab and before they pull the fire alarm to warn the laundry workers to escape. Subverted when Walt sets up a car to explode and starts calmly walking away. But it takes longer than he was expecting, so eventually he just awkwardly sits down and waits for it.
Gus does this after being the one to GET blown up.
Yet another one occurs right after Walt and Jesse blow up the superlab and before they pull the fire alarm to warn the laundry workers to escape.
The Unreveal: We never do find out if Gus ordered the murder of the child meth dealer, or whether Gus's other dealers did that on their own hook. Just what led to Walt's disastrous decision to accept a $5000 buyout and leave Gray Matter is never explained, even when Walt admits to Jesse that the whole Gray Matter incident is the reason he wants to keep cooking meth. There are small hints here and there to why, such as the never-fully-explained rift in Gretchen and Walt. Vince Gilligan eventually explained this one;Walt left the company and their relationship because he felt inferior. ...He didnt realize the girl he was about to marry was so very wealthy and came from such a prominent family, and it kind of blew his mind and made him feel inferior and he overreacted. He just kind of checked out. Many things about Walt's backstory are left unexplained, such as why he became a high school chemistry teacher despite being an overqualified genius.

Vertigo Effect: Done very briefly with Walt in the desert in "Ozymandias" after Hank gets shot.
Villainous Breakdown: Walt has one in "Crawl Space" when he begins laughing hysterically, though it's more of an anti-hero/villain breakdown. Walt appears to have a truly vicious one in "Ozymandias" when he calls Skyler on the phone and lays into her with a snarling, vitriolic rant that makes it seem like any hint of love he ever showed for her was either a lie to begin with or had dissolved into hatred long ago. However, he knew the phone was being tapped, and it was mostly an act to convince the police that Skyler was a wholly innocent victim... but it remains ambiguous to the viewer (and to Skyler) how much, if any, of the stuff he said was a reflection of what he really thought. Certainly, parts of it are only exaggerations of criticisms he's previously made to her in more restrained terms.

Wham Line: In season 1's "Cancer Man", after Jesse is kicked out of the house after a joint is found in his room, his brother Jake goes up to him and says this:Jake: Thanks for not telling on me. In season 1's "Crazy Handful Of Nothin'", Walt cooks what looks like meth but is actually a highly reactive explosive that he uses to threaten Tuco.Walt: This... is not meth. In the Season 2 finale "ABQ", while Walt is under anesthesia: Skyler: Walt, did you bring your cell phone? Walt: Which one? Another line later in the same episode which kickstarts the climactic plane crash:Don: Juliet-Mike-21... ...climb and maintain 17,000. Clear direct to Albuquerque via the Aircraft calling, please stand by. Jane-Mike-21, turn, heading Disregard. In the season 3 premiere:Skyler: You're a drug dealer. Forms the name of the episode "I.F.T.":Skyler: I fucked Ted. The last line of the Season 4 episode "Cornered". Hank finds evidence that links Gale to Los Pollos Hermanos and, by extension, to Gustavo Fring.Hank: Since when do vegans eat fried chicken? From "Crawl Space":Gus: If you interfere, the problem becomes much simpler. I will kill your wife. I will kill your son. I will kill your infant daughter. From "Face Off". Walt's plan to kill Gus goes off without a hitch and he tells Skyler exactly that.Walt: I won. From "Fifty-One":Skyler: [I'm waiting] for the cancer to come back. A flashback version that Hank recalls in "Gliding Over All":Hank: "To W.W. My star, my perfect silence." W.W. I mean, who do you figure that is, y'know? Woodrow Wilson? Willy Wonka?... Walter White? Walt: You got me. From "Blood Money". Walter threatens his own brother-in-law.Walt: If you don't know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly. From "Confessions", After Marie finds out about Walt's meth empire.Marie: Why don't you just kill yourself, Walt?

Wham Shot: The final shot in "Face Off", showing the Lily of the Valley in Walter's garden that was used to poison Brock. The final shot of "Gliding Over All", where we see Gale wrote a dedication to Walter in the Walt Whitman book he gave him, and Hank is reading it, finally connecting the dots. "Confessions": That look on Jesse's face when he figures out who lifted the ricin-packed cigarette. And pretty much every minute after that as Jesse goes on a rampage. "Ozymandias": The shot of Skyler reaching for the kitchen knife over the phone after discovering Hank is dead.

What Happened to the Mouse?: Huell was last seen left in a safe house by Hank and Steve and is never mentioned again. It's been joked by the crew that he's still in that room. We never find out what became of the barrels of Walt's cash that Uncle Jack stole. Ted Beneke's ultimate fate is never brought up as well. The last that is said about him is that he may never walk again, so that's obviously an ambiguous situation which isn't cleared up when he disappears from the narrative.

You Have Outlived Your Usefulness: Lydia suggests this to Mike, who angrily rejects the idea of killing eleven people who he personally vetted and trusts to be loyal. She tries to go through with the plan anyway. Lydia almost suffered this at Walt's hands, only squeezing out by talking him into using her to ship his product overseas.
Lydia suggests this to Mike, who angrily rejects the idea of killing eleven people who he personally vetted and trusts to be loyal. She tries to go through with the plan anyway.
You Keep Telling Yourself That: Both Jesse and Skyler have called Walter out whenever he's tried to rationalize the safety of his family or others, and also the reasoning for his actions. Subverted in the last episode; he honestly tells Skyler he did everything for himself.
You Kill It, You Bought It: Defied by Mike, when Walt is disappointed with the profits they make when they start distributing for themselves after the death of Gus, who'd built his empire up over decades.Mike: Just because you killed Jesse James...don't make you Jesse James.
You Monster!: Hank says this to Walt when he confronts him for being Heisenberg.

Enemy Mine: How Walter gets Héctor Salamanca to kill Gus. Hank and Jesse come to an arrangement like this regarding Walt in Season 5.
Hank and Jesse come to an arrangement like this regarding Walt in Season 5.
Establishing Character Moment: Walt's first dialogue. The audience is first led to think that he's about to make a confession video...only for Walt to say, "This is not admission of guilt." Jesse first shows up stumbling down a window half-naked just moments after the DEA barged into the meth lab he is supposed to be working in. Skyler's ECM happens when she is giving Walt a handjob as his birthday present... But before Walt could climax, Skyler gets distracted when she sees something else come up, leaving Walt in the cold. As for Hank, it's when he takes his brother-in-law's glass, raises it for a toast... and then drinks from it himself. As if his cheesy TV commercial wasn't enough, the first time Saul appears in the flesh, he wipes the floor with a gawky cop that was interrogating Badger. In his first couple of scenes, Todd appears to be a competent, unfailingly polite henchman.  Then he unhesitatingly kills a child in cold blood.

Eureka Moment: Hank has his when he finds a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass in the Whites' bathroom containing a written message from Gale to his other favorite "W.W.". Walt, when he watches Elliott and Gretchen being interviewed on Charlie Rose.  He realizes that he can get his money to his family without them rejecting it (or it being seized by the FBI), if he compels the Schwartzes to donate it to them.
Walt, when he watches Elliott and Gretchen being interviewed on Charlie Rose.  He realizes that he can get his money to his family without them rejecting it (or it being seized by the FBI), if he compels the Schwartzes to donate it to them.
Even Evil Has Loved Ones: A recurring theme. All of the important villains have family or friends they care about. Walter, rapidly losing any moral high ground he might have started with, and his meth production motivated more by greed and pride than anything else, still loves his family, and he does care for Jesse too. Though by the end of Season 5, he has alienated everyone he loved. A flashback reveals that the Salamanca kids have had this stomped into them by their uncle Héctor. Tuco cares for his uncle in spite of being an Axe-Crazy meth-head drug lord, and the Salamanca twins make an arduous journey into America to ruthlessly avenge Tuco's death. And when Gus eliminates most of the Salamancas and their gang, Hector volunteers to blow up both of them. Gus' main motive for being in organized crime is to avenge the murder of his best friend and would-be partner in crime, Max. Mike is devoted to his granddaughter Kaylee. Todd also has a strong relationship with his uncle Jack and his gang.

Even Evil Has Standards: Subverted when Gus acts insulted by Walt's accusation of him of murdering a child. He openly threatens to have Walt's family, including his infant daughter, murdered. Even Victor is disturbed and angered by all-around Nice Guy Gale's death. Although implied since almost the beginning, Walt finally stated to Saul in one episode that hurting any family members is a line that he will never, ever cross. Given how much Walt's morals have descended over the course of the series, that's saying a lot.  Indeed, when finally cornered by Hank and Jesse, Walt opts to surrender and be arrested rather than harm his brother-in-law. Mike seems to be disgusted by Walt bombing a nursing home and by the idea of bombing a police station and killing a bunch of cops. He is also extremely pissed at Todd for killing a kid. Given that Mike is both an ex-cop and a grandfather it makes sense. Saul refuses to give up Walt and Jesse's location to Mike at the end of Season 3, risks his own life when he tips off the DEA to the hit on Hank in late Season 4, and is horrified in "Live Free or Die" when he learns that he was involved in Walt's plan to poison Brock.

Evil Versus Evil: The conflict between Gus and the Cartel. Both sides have well proven how morally terrible they are, and despite Gus's organization being presented in a A Lighter Shade of Black around the time the conflict hit its apex,  Gus then threatened to kill Walt's entire family, including his baby daughter. This after the audience had been given the impression he didn't want to use children for nefarious purposes or harm them in any fashion. While it started as a dark Black and Grey Morality, by the end, Walter's conflict against Gus turned into this.
Face Death with Dignity: Mike decides to sit on a rock in silence, admiring the Scenery Porn, as he dies of a gut shot. Hank in "Ozymandias", staring down the barrel of a neo-Nazi gun.Hank:

"Facing the Bullets" One-Liner: "My name is ASAC Schrader, and you can go fuck yourself."
Failed a Spot Check: Somehow, the Nazis just plumb forgot to check under that car. They didn't check Walt's trunk in "Felina", either. Earlier, Tyrus fails to spot  the bomb attached to Hector's wheelchair.
Earlier, Tyrus fails to spot  the bomb attached to Hector's wheelchair.
Failed Attempt at Drama: While it is certainly not played for laughs, Walt tries to threaten Saul into working for him before they leave with their new identities but is interrupted by a long coughing fit. This prompts Saul to leave as soon as he could before Walt could finish.
Fate Worse Than Death:  Jesse in "Ozymandias." Instead of killing him,  Jack's gang takes him captive, tortures him for information, and then forces him to cook meth for them by threatening Andrea and Brock. Aaron Paul himself has said that Jesse would definitely prefer death.
Fire-Forged Friends: Walt and Jesse start off quite rocky, and they come to blows several times. However, they eventually build a father-son relationship, with each committing murder to protect the other on several occasions. Their relationship seems to fall apart by the end of the series, however.
Five-Bad Band Los Pollos Hermanos: Big Bad: Gustavo "Gus" Fring. The Dragon: Mike Ehrmantraut Evil Genius(s): Gale Boetticher and Walter White. The Brute: Victor. Later replaced by Tyrus. The Dark Chick: Jesse Pinkman Heisenberg's Empire: Big Bad: Walter White/Heisenberg The Dragon: Jesse Pinkman Evil Genius: Saul Goodman The Brute: Mike Ermantraut, temporarily, followed by  Todd.

Five-Second Foreshadowing: Gus realizes Hector's plan about a half-second before it blows up in his face.
Flaw Exploitation: Walt wins by exploiting Gus' one flaw: the man's hatred of the Salamancas. Lydia's routine of meeting associates at the same table in the same coffee shop (and adding Stevia to her drink) proves her undoing. Walt puts ricin in the Stevia packet at her table.

Foregone Conclusion: The use of Flash Forwards in some opening scenes means that the audience knows ahead of time some of the things that will happen during the show. Jesse is seen soaking the White family's living room in gasoline in "Confessions" but the Flash Forward in "Blood Money" shows Walt returning to the house. Although it may be abandoned and in disrepair, it hasn't been burned down.
Foreshadowing: Walt is told by the doctor when he got cancer in his birthday, that in the best case scenario, he has only 2 years to live. Walt dies exactly 2 years later, just not by cancer. Hank takes Walter Jr to a SRO to try and scare him straight about marijuana, and it sounds like something out of the worst after-school special ever, with all his bullshit about gateway drugs. Only look at what's happened to Walter over the last five seasons and ask yourself, "What did Hank say about gateway crimes again? How they ruin your lives?" Jesse called Walt 'Hitler' after Walt asked regarding the hydrofloric acid.  An year and 4 seasons later, Jesse finds himself as a literal slave to Neo-Nazis. Walt disregards the Schwartzes' money during his cancer treatment, due to issues of charity and unresolved issues regarding Gretchen and Grey Matter. In an example of Irony, this is how Walt launders rest of his 10 million dollars to Flynn and Skyler, through a supposed act of charity. As in, he threatened Elliot and Gretchen to donate the money for him. Several Cold Opens in season 2 reveal progressively more of a mysterious crime scene, the circumstances of which are not revealed until the finale. Moreover, the titles of the episodes spell out the impending disaster: "737"/"Down"/"Over"/"ABQ". Plus, the teddy bear in the plane crash also foreshadows  Gus's death. A lot of the chemistry classes in the first season, like the one about explosions. Walt's lecture on chirality doesn't appear to have any relevance on anything later in the episode until you remember that methamphetamine is a chiral molecule. In "Over", Jesse wants to bring Jane breakfast in bed, but she walks on him in the kitchen. He says "You weren't supposed to wake up", and she responds "Ever, or...?" You can tell Tio wants Gus dead early in their confrontations, but it doesn't appear to mean much as Tio can't do anything. Come the Season 4 finale, however, he finally gets his revenge... and sorts out Walt's problems at the same time. Hank's condition in 'One Minute' before he kills Marco is exactly like the time he's injured in 'Ozymandias'. Sadly, this time he didn't survive. In the season 2 premiere, you see Skyler looking fondly of old photos of her and Ted after she and Walt start having marriage troubles. Ted isn't even introduced at that point and doesn't appear till 6 episodes after. Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, a faceless international conglomerate, was first mentioned significantly in Season 4, when it is revealed that the company owns the industrial laundry that houses the superlab. The company was shown to own Los Pollos Hermanos in the fine print of a television ad in Season 3. The company's full role was only revealed in Season 5. At the beginning of "Peekaboo" we see Skinny Pete stomp out a beetle. Later, Spooge's head gets crushed by an ATM. Both were done without second thoughts and the same aloof amount of ease. Season five starts with a flashforward, giving a tantalizing glimpse of how the series will end. Gus once said Walt, "A man provides. Even though he is not appreciated."  Walt manages to win in his original goal, providing money to his family, when he becomes a nation-wide most wanted, with his family disowning him. The teddy bear in the season 2 premiere foreshadows  how Gus dies in the Season 4 finale. In a fit of anger, Jesse calls Todd "Ricky Hitler". Todd's uncle has prison connections in the Aryan Brotherhood. Twice in 2x12's "Phoenix". First Jane tells Jesse to roll over on his side after shooting up in case he vomits ("Lie on your side, or you might choke"), and Walter does the same thing for his infant daughter. When Walt tries to shake Jesse awake at the end of the episode to talk to him, Jane rolls over on her back, and a few minutes later throws up and starts choking. At the beginning of season 2, Jesse tries to convince Walt to sacrifice his life for him, since he's going to die of cancer anyway. Fast-forward to "Felina," in which Walt is fatally wounded after pushing Jesse to the ground to spare him from being hit by the rigged machine gun. Early in season 5, Skyler tells Walt she doesn't want her kids living in a household where people being murdered is brushed off with "shit happens." Fast forward a couple of episodes later, and Todd says "shit happens" after murdering a kid. In "Blood Money", Badger's Star Trek script may foreshadow some of the events of the final season.  Badger claims that the crew of the Enterprise are having a pie eating contest, and that it is down to just three: Kirk (Hank), Spock (Walter) and Chekhov (Jack). Kirk is the first to leave, foreshadowing Hank's death in "Ozymandias". Chekhov has Scotty (Todd) helping him, but when Uhura (Lydia) walks in, Scotty accidentally gets Chekhov killed, leaving Spock as the winner. If Todd hadn't become attracted to Lydia, Walter likely wouldn't have killed Jack and his gang, as they had to keep Jesse alive in order to keep making the meth, prompting Walt to go after them. Ted stumbles slightly over  his rug, which he takes the time to go back and smooth out before going to answer the door for Skyler. Later, Huell and Kuby come to force him to sign a check for the IRS. Guess what Ted trips over when he tries to make his escape? In Season 4, Andrea tells Jesse  that she'll "die first" before letting anything happen to her son Brock. Fast-forward to "Granite State," and Todd shoots her in the head. Fortunately, Brock does survive the series. Walt's state in "Crawl Space" is  exactly the pose how he dies. Walt ominously mentions Victor while disregarding Mike's request for hazard-paying Gus's men.  Walt not only kills Mike regarding Gus's men, but his downfall can also be attributed to Walt's words,'He flew too close to the sun, and got his throat cut.' Jesse establishes Walt as a credible threat and as one to never be underestimated, when he states that 'Seriously guys, what you guys are expecting, the exact opposite is going to happen'.  Hank, Gomez and Jesse successfully arrest Walt, only for Walt's Nazi backup to arrive, kill Hank and Gomez and imprison Jesse. Walt arrived back in Todd's life, where he planned with Lydia to Mercy Kill Walt. Well, Todd was killed along with his uncle and his crew, and Lydia herself was poisoned with ricin when Walt made his final entry. Jesse expected to cook one more batch of meth, only for Walt to arrive back in his life, and Jesse suddenly going free, as all his captors are dead.

Frame-Up: In "Confessions," Walt makes a tape that paints Hank as the Lawman Gone Bad mastermind behind everything he did, and himself as a coerced stooge. It won't get him off anything, but the threat of Taking You with Me is clear.
Freudian Trio: Walt, Jesse, and Mike in Season 5A. Sure enough, the first time Walt and Mike are alone without Jesse to mediate, Walt kills Mike.
Gambit Roulette: Walt poisoned Brock with a not-quite lethal poison and stole the ricin cigarette from Jesse, hoping that Jesse would realize he was poisoned, assume Walt did it and come after him. Then he had to convince Jesse that Gus had planned to the whole thing, right up to Jesse holding a gun to his head. It worked (almost) perfectly, but relied on a lot of luck. Gus' wholesale poisoning of the cartel in "Salud" also depended on a lot of luck (see One Dose Fits All below). The way Walt takes out  the Aryan Brotherhood depended on them a.) allowing him to position the car where he wanted, b.) not searching the trunk, c.) putting his keychain somewhere he could get a hold of it, d.) all gathering in the same room at the same time. Jesse wasn't kidding when he lampshades that Walt is "luckier than you."

Get Out:  Skyler pulls this on Walt in Ozymandias after she figures out that Hank is dead. When Walt doesnt comply, she tries to kill him.
Gilligan Cut (Or perhaps a Vince Gilligan Cut): After Marie's bet with Hank over whether he can still get erect after his injuries and surgery. In the season 4 finale, when Marie forbids Hank to leave the house and go to the DEA after they receive a tip about an assassination planned on him. Cue Hank in the DEA. Also doubles as an ironic echo for the previous situation.

Gone Horribly Right: Walter White just wanted to make some cash to play his medical bills and leave some left over for his family. By "Gliding Over All," he made more than enough. A desperate man with sympathetic medical problems and not much savvy looked like an ideal get-rich-quick opportunity with a limited shelf life and blowback to Saul Goodman. He helped create Heisenberg. That went so well.
Gorn: Not every episode, but at least once or twice a season something mind-blowingly gruesome happens. Several dissolved corpses over the course of the show. The decapitated-head-turtle-bombing in "Negro y Azul" results in quite a lot of carnage. In "Box Cutter," Gus slices open a neck with one. Gus Fring's death. Mike's crew are stabbed dozens of times, with the last one doused with flammable liquid and burned.

Heel Realization: Jesse comes to this in Season 3 premiere "No Mas" after getting out of rehab, following Jane's death, which came after he tempted her into relapsing.Jesse: I'm the bad guy. Walt has his own by "Felina", when he finally admits to Skyler that he cooked for his own gratification rather than for the good of the family, saying, "I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really... I was alive."

He Knows Too Much: Deconstructed. Walt thinks he's covering his tracks by killing Mike and his entire team so that nobody can trace his crimes back to him. The problem is, in order to pull off this bloodbath he has to get in bed with Todd's Uncle Jack and his gang, who turn out to be more of a liability than the loyal crew Mike was paying huge amounts of hush money.
He Who Fights Monsters: Season 4's finale has Walt pulling off a Batman Gambit and finally killing Gus. Part of that plan happens to involve poisoning an innocent child (albeit non-lethally) to manipulate Jesse. Things only go downhill from there.
The Hero Dies: Both Walt (the show's Villain Protagonist) and Hank (the show's Hero Antagonist) are dead by the end of the series.
Heroes Act, Villains Hinder: The show is mainly about the chaos caused by its hero, Walter White. Most of Walt's major enemies (the only exception being Hank in Season 5) are decidedly worse people than him and thus can properly be called villains, but their involvement in the plot is still a result of his actions.
Heroic Blue Screen of Death: Jesse when he finds Jane dead. He has to be slapped out of it by Mike who wants him to tell police that he "woke up, he found her, that's all [he] know[s]." Jesse in Season 4 premiere "Box Cutter", too shaken up to even flee the crime scene. Walt at the end of "Crawl Space" after Skyler tells him she gave the money they needed to escape Gus to Ted Beneke. Hank in "Blood Money." The realization that Walt is Heisenberg brings back his panic attacks with a vengeance. By the time Walt confronts him later in the episode, Hank is clearly a distraught, shaken man. Jesse is basically a walking BSoD throughout "Buried." Given all he's been through up to that point, it's hardly a surprise, too. "Ozymandias" Walt gets one when he witnesses Jack kill Hank despite all he does to save him.. So does Marie when she finds out about it. Walt Jr. gets one when  Skyler and Marie confess everything about the meth-making activities Skyler's occurs when Walt kidnaps Holly and flees.

Hollywood Magnetism: Mostly averted by the magnet used in The Caper. Walt points out that the frame of his glasses and his wedding ring are aluminium and gold, respectively, and the crew have to add a second row of batteries to get enough amperage to get through the wall of the evidence room.
Honest Corporate Executive: Gus Fring's public image. It's totally wrong, but it is his public image, up until the day he dies.
Hope Spot: Inverted with Gus Fring's death. After Hector detonates himself, Gus Fring walks out of the gutted room, seemingly fine... and the viewer's stomachs drop as they think the plan failed. Then the camera pans to show the half of Gus's face that isn't there. Most of "Gliding Over All" qualifies, until the Wham Shot. In "Granite State", Jesse's hard-won escape from his torture pit is foiled by the Aryans just as he reaches the compound's perimeter fence. In "To'hajiilee", Hank and Jesse trick Walt into leading them to his money and giving Hank enough evidence to arrest him. Hank even calls Marie to tell her he's finally caught Walt. Then Uncle Jack arrives with his heavily-armed neo-Nazis.

How We Got Here: The episodes "Pilot", "Crazy Handful of Nothin'", "Grilled", "Breakage", "ABQ", and "Bug". The entire second season is the journey towards a grim future which was teased at the start of several episodes, including the season's premiere. Going beyond In Medias Res, the events of these flash-forwards take place between the Season 2 finale and the Season 3 premiere. "Live Free or Die", the first episode of the final season, starts with a glimpse to a year ahead (and yet another Ironic Birthday) showing a now more rugged-looking Walt travelling under a fake identity and purchasing an M60 Machine Gun to kill the Aryan Brotherhood and rescue Jesse. "Blood Money", the premiere episode of the second half of Season 5 starts off after the M60 purchase showing Walt going back home, which after the events of the last year has now been closed off and abandoned.

Humiliation Conga: Several dramatic ones. Jesse suffers one in "Down", which leaves him broke and homeless, with no one to help him, covered in sewage water and disinfectant and eventually crying himself to sleep while wearing a gas mask on the floor of the RV. Season 4 is one long one for Walt. Season 5's first half is one for Mike up until his death. Walt himself suffers a nasty one in Season 5. His brother-in-law is killed in front of him, the majority of his money is stolen, the world finds out who he is and he's forced to go on the run, his own wife attacks him, and it looks like he'll be forced to live out his final days in a freezing shack in the middle of nowhere. Then, just when it looks like it can't get any worse, his son disowns him and he overhears his colleagues - who are now far more successful than him - badmouthing him on national TV. The Grand Finale gives him a chance to make a comeback, but whether he deserves it at this point is debatable.

I Know You Know I Know: Hank and Walt play this game for a bit after Hank finds out Walt's Heisenberg. But it ends pretty quickly after Walt confronts Hank about the tracker on his car.
Ignored Epiphany: In "Granite State," Walter, after hearing that his son flat-out refuses his drug money and wishes him to die, calls the DEA to surrender and accept his fate. While he waits for the cops, however, he sees Elliot and Gretchen disowning their association to Walt on TV, specifically saying that Walt has never done anything for Gray Matter except giving the company its name. At that point, Breaking Bad's theme song kicks in, pride retakes control of Walt, and he vanishes again as Heisenberg.
Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy: "To'hajiilee" ends with Hank and Gomez up against the Aryans, the latter armed with assault rifles and even an automatic shotgun. Ultimately subverted in "Ozymandias" when it turns out that the bulletproof vest-wearing Gomez is killed (because even the best vest will eventually fail) and Hank was hit in the leg. Played with further when you look at the cars. Hank's is a perforated wreck, meaning the Aryans' More Dakka did land quite a few hits, but their own cars are pristine and none of the Neo-Nazis themselves are even injured despite Gomez having blasted away at them with a shotgun at very close range.
Implied Death Threat: "Blood Money" has Walt deliver one: "If you dont know who I am, maybe your best course of action is to tread lightly." However, the threat is empty; as it's shown later, Walt would rather go to prison than to kill Hank.
Incurable Cough of Death: Walt's coughing in the pilot is a sign of his cancer. Subverted; in the episode where he starts coughing up blood, he panics, but it turns out that his cancer is going into remission and that was just a relatively minor secondary condition. Played straight again in season five; when his cancer comes back, he starts coughing again.
Played straight again in season five; when his cancer comes back, he starts coughing again.
Insufferable Genius: Walt cooks the best meth, and he's not afraid to remind people of it. The cartel's meth cook Benicio Fuentes also counts as this. He repeatedly criticizes Jesse, but even the Don points out that Jesse still cooks better meth than he does, with all of his college degrees.

Internal Reveal: Walter watching  Jane die in season 2. The threat of that truth being revealed added tension to a lot of the many disputes Walt and Jesse got into.  Walt poisoning Brock was another case, though it was not kept secret for as long.
Walt poisoning Brock was another case, though it was not kept secret for as long.
Interrupted Intimacy: In  In Season 4, Episode 5, Skyler and Walt have sex to celebrate their signing of the papers which finalize their purchase of A1A carwash from Bogdan Wolynetz and abruptly end their sexual intercourse when Walter Jr enters the house - Walt Sr was THIS CLOSE to being caught naked by his son. Walt Jr. does realize what is going on though, and leaves the scene in disgust.
Ironic Birthday: Walt has just terrible luck with birthdays: In the very first episode, he comes home from the hospital on his 50th birthday, having just learned that he has terminal cancer, to find a surprise party in his living room. Season five episode "51" features his next birthday (with a lampshade hung on how long a year it's been), celebrated for Walt Jr's sake despite the fact that he and Skyler are barely on speaking terms. He actually requests a "surprise" party along the lines of his last one, in an attempt to persuade Skyler that life is back to normal. Instead he gets a simple dinner with Hank and Marie during which Skyler tries to drown herself. The Cold Open to season five shows his 52nd birthday in a flash-forward, "celebrated" alone in a diner, using a new identity.

Ironic Echo: Quite a few. After Skyler confronts Jesse and almost catches him moving Emilio's body, he angrily tells Walt, "good job on wearing the pants in the family." Later, when Jane gets Walt to give Jesse the money owed to him, Walt says, "nice job wearing the pants." Saul's speech to Walt about his looming divorce in S3E2, "Caballo Sin Nombre", is very reminiscent of Walt's address to the students after the plane crash in S3E1, "No Más." Walt's speech to Skyler in the second episode of season 5 about how doing bad things for the sake of family is justifiable is highly reminiscent of a similar speech given to the twins by Tio Salamanca in a flashback in season 3. Given the general audience reaction to the Salamancas, it's a pretty chilling indication of the direction in which Walt is headed. In "Cornered", Walt says to Skyler: "I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger." In "Fifty-One", he tells her: "I can promise you that Gus Fring is dead. And he was the threat. He was the danger." Skyler responds, "I thought you were the danger." Todd's explanation of his motives repeats Walt's argument to Gus about Gale nearly word-for-word. In "Fifty-One", Skyler says to Walt: "I will not have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as shit happens'!" In "Buyout", after Todd kills a child witness and he, Jesse, Walt and Mike dispose of the body, he tells Jesse: "Man, shit happens, huh?" Jesse punches him in the face. Walt keeping up a façade as an overly friendly staffmember when Lydia comes to the car wash to confront him in season 5, often refusing to answer her questions and treating her like just another customer - the exact same approach Gus Fring used on him whenever he came to Los Pollos Hermanos.

Irony: The final season is packed with this. After sacrificing so much over the story arc to raise hospital and inheritance money, Walt ends up losing absolutely everything in the process. The penultimate episode has him sitting alone in the middle of nowhere, suffering from cancer again, and down to his last barrel of cash he can neither spend nor give to his family. Also, Walt has taken a great many drug dealers off the streets during his tenure as a drug cooker and later drug kingpin. Krazy-8, Tuco, Gus, Declan, Jack and the Nazis, Lydia. Possibly also the Mexican cartel Gus was part of, if Walt can be considered instrumental to their extermination. Walt did a better job of getting drugs off the street than Hank.
Irrevocable Order: A variation in "To'hajiilee"; thinking that Jesse has lured him to a remote location in order to kill him and take his money, Walt calls Uncle Jack and gives him the co-ordinates and the green light to kill Jesse. When he realises that it's Hank come to arrest him, he calls Jack to tell him not to come — but the gang come anyway. There's actually a reason for it: Jack's gang knew that something was at this particular spot because Walt gave the exact geographical coordinates as opposed to some vague description of the location - in this case, his money.
It Gets Easier: Walt agonizes over his first hands-on kill for almost an entire episode, and breaks down into tears when he finally does it. As the show goes on, he becomes less and less averse to using lethal violence to achieve his goals. Walt comes out and admits it to Skyler when she's freaking out about her actions indirectly getting Ted paralysed and almost killed.
Jumping Off the Slippery Slope: While Skyler compromises her morals throughout the series because of her relationship with Walt, when she tells Walt to kill Jesse, she goes straight from money laundering and blackmail to proposing murder.

Karma Houdini Warranty/Laser-Guided Karma: Vince Gilligan has stated that one Central Theme of the series is that all actions have consequences. At some point everyone has to reap the results of all their decisions and actions, even if it takes many years — and they come either as gruesome (but deserved) deaths or being forced to live with the stigma of guilt. In the finale Jesse managed to survive because at that point he realized his colossal mistake in getting involved in the meth industry, and Saul realizes that even with an assumed identity he will never regain the prosperity he had with Walter.
Kick the Dog: After Walt forces Bogdan to sell him the car wash in Season 4, he refuses to let Bogdan take anything with him as he leaves—not even the first dollar that he ever made, which he keeps framed on the wall of his office. As soon as Bogdan leaves, Walt shatters the glass frame, takes the dollar out, and spends it on the nearest soda machine. Although Bogdan's behavior puts some Kick the Son of a Bitch into the scene, this act of petty cruelty speaks volumes about how far Walt has fallen since the show's beginning. Walt does this to Jesse in "Ozymandias" when  he admits letting Jane die in her overdose. The climax of season four which has Walt poison Brock in order to manipulate Jesse is presented as a new low for Walter's slide into villainy.

Knows a Guy Who Knows a Guy: How Saul arranges a meeting between Walter White and Gus Fring. Becomes practically Saul's catchphrase as the series goes on and Walt and Jesse require the services of more and more shady characters. Walt even calls him out on it during the scene where they're waiting to be given new lives by Saul's 'clean slate' man; Walt asks for the names of hitmen to take out Jack and his gang, and Saul says he doesn't know any. Walt tells him that surely he knows someone who ALSO knows someone.Saul: Lets just say I know a guy who knows a guy... [beat] who knows another guy.
Knuckle Tattoos: One of Jack's men has a phrase tattooed across his knuckles, which can be best seen  when he holds has hand across Skyler's mouth when Todd threatens her.
Late-Arrival Spoiler: The teaser ad for Season 5 is the scene of Gus Fring's death.
Laughing Mad: Walt's reaction when Skyler tells him she gave Ted the $600,000 they needed to escape Gus, who said he would kill them all if he interfered in tipping off the DEA about the hit on Hank... which Saul had done on his orders mere minutes before.
Laser-Guided Karma: Most of the cast. Bogdan is a Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk who names a ridiculous price (well over 20x the actual value) when Skyler tries to buy the car wash. Then when he's desperate to sell because he thinks the EPA is about to shut him down due to a toxic waste leak, she lowers her original offer by almost 10%, explicitly saying she's doing so because she doesn't like him. When he hands the keys over to Walt, he makes a big point that he's selling the business "as is." He then goes to take his framed "first dollar"... and Walt reminds him he sold the business "as is." The instant Bogdan walks out, Walt smashes the frame, takes the dollar, and buys a soda with it. At the end of the fourth season, Don Eladio, the head of the Mexican cartel dies at the exact spot where he ordered the death of Gus' partner. Extra points for Gus being the one to poison him, after making a deal with him over crystal meth (a substance he used to scoff at). Ted, who after refusing to use the money Skyler gave him for her intended purpose (to avoid getting arrested for tax fraud), is visited by goons sent by Saul on Skyler's orders and forced into signing the check. When he tries to run, he slips on his rug and ends up paralyzed as a result of his injury.. This happens to Walt in "Ozymandias" in brutal fashion: Uncle Jack executes Hank and takes 70 of Walt's 80 million in meth profits, his family disowns him because of Hank's death and Walt Jr. discovering his father is Heisenberg, and Walt finally realizes how wrong his rationalizations were. At the end of the episode, he's forced to embrace his Heisenberg persona and flee Albuquerque with the help of Saul's identity-changer. Since  Lydia's debut episode, she was a Karma Houdini. However, in "Felina",  Lydia finally gets what she deserves, when Walt's final battle begins with him poisoning her tea with the ricin he stole from Jesse. By the time Walt calls to tell her what happened, she's already too close to death to do anything about it. Vanco, who spent most of his time in "Negro y Azul" making fun of Hank for not speaking Spanish (using the language barrier to get away with trash-talking to his fellow coworkers) and reacting in horror to Tortuga's head on the tortoise. When the explosives in the tortoise go off, Vanco's leg gets blown off below the knee.

Laser Sight: Walt intimidates Elliot and Gretchen by telling them he spent $200,000 hiring "the two best hitmen west of the Mississippi" to keep tabs on them until they go through with his demands — cue laser dots on their chests. Subverted when it turns out it was just Badger and Skinny Pete with laser pointers.
Last Episode Theme Reprise: In the second last episode, as a build up to the Grand Finale, has Walter give the DEA his position; suddenly spurred on, the full theme song plays as the police raid the bar Walter called from, only to find his unfinished drink and tip. The full theme also plays over the credits of the Series Finale.

Lawman Gone Bad: Walt cooks up a false confession that hinges on framing Hank as one of these who manipulated his poor cash-strapped cancer-patient brother-in-law into cooking meth for him to sell through his criminal contacts, and he sends the tape to Hank as a threat. Even as he watches it, Hank can see it's a more plausible story than the truth. Ex-cop turned hitman Mike qualifies too. He tells Walt about illegally threatening a suspect, the DEA agents who interrogate him imply that his career in law enforcement didn't end well, and Better Call Saul reveals that he not only took bribes, but also murdered the crooked cops who set up the death of his police officer son Matty.
Leave No Witnesses: A few times. In "Dead Freight," Mike points out that in his experience, "there are two kinds of heist; those where the guys get away with it, and those that leave witnesses." They eventually come up with a way to do the job without being seen by the train's crew, but they don't count on Innocent Bystanders.
A Lighter Shade of Black: A common motif in the series, with Walt and Jesse as nicer drug lords than the people they generally oppose. However, by the final season it's clear that Walt has become about as evil as the rest of the industry.
Literary Allusion Title: "Gliding Over All", from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. "Ozymandias", from Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem. It's about what happens when someone's reputation crumbles and only their name is left behind. A promo for the episode has Bryan Cranston reciting it over shots of the New Mexico desert. "Felina" is a reference to Marty Robbins' song "El Paso", which is about a cowboy returning to the town where he escaped from the past to see his lover, Feleena again. The song even plays briefly in the episode.
